The Idea: Why is this better than the old way?
The old way of doing things is not always the best way. There are new ideas that can be better than what we have been using.

How can technology help solve these challenges?
Technology has the potential to help solve many of the world’s challenges. This includes improving access to education, improving healthcare, and reducing pollution. However, there are still a number of challenges that need to be addressed. One such challenge is the lack of accessible information. Another challenge is the high cost of technology. However, technology can help address both of these challenges. For example, Google has developed a project called “Chromecast” which allows users to watch television shows and movies online. This project is a great way for people who are not able to watch television or film in an original way.

The environment: How will we handle the increasing amount of pollution?
In an effort to save the planet, many people are trying to devise new ways of living that do not rely on traditional methods of production. One such way is using green technology. 
One idea that has been gaining attention is the use of clean energy sources like solar and wind power. These sources provide clean energy that can be used to produce electricity without causing any pollution. 

It is important to note that these types of technologies are still in their development and will likely have a longer timeline before they are fully implemented on a large scale. However, if done correctly, these types of technologies could help us avoid some of the biggest pollutants on Earth.

I was born in 1984, and I'm now a Sophomore at Stanford University in California. My parents were both Scientists. My father is a Scientist and my mother is a Engineer. I always loved Science because it was the only thing that was constant in my life. When I was younger, I would watch molecule-by-molecule movies and take detailed notes on what everything looked like. This led to me wanting to become a Scientist myself one day.

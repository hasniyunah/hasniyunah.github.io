What do we mean by big ideas?
When it comes to big ideas, there's no one definitive answer. What matters most is what the idea can do for people, and how it could change the way they live and work. 
Big ideas are those that are so great they're hard to ignore or forget. They can solve a problem that's been bothering people for years, or help create a new industry or global standard. 
To come up with the perfect big idea, you need to have a vision, be passionate about your project, and have the guts to take on a challenge. But before all that, you need some strong convictions (or at least a willingness to experiment). 
Here are five tips for coming up with big ideas: 
1) Define your problem: Your ideal customer won't always be available or willing to do business with you, so define your target market first.

Projects: How to do a project without any tools?
If you're like most people, you probably think of when you need to do a project without any tools, it's when you're in your garage or workshop. But there are many ways to do a project without any tools that can be very satisfying. Here are two examples: 
1. Make a DIY painting project: Start by picking the colors you want and drawing the basic shapes for your painting using pencil and paper. Once you have a basic idea, just start painting! You can use whatever materials you have lying around the house, such as cans of paint or spray cans of different colors. 

2. Build an Ikea chest: This is another great way to do a project without any tools! All you need is some wood screws and nails, some light-tricks (like X-acto knives), and some sandpaper (if needed).

The State of Invention Today
Invention is a vital part of our economy and society. Yet, it has been difficult to keep up with the growth of invention. Inventions have become more common, but the number of new ideas remains low. This lack of innovation is costing society billions of dollars each year in lost revenue and jobs.
Despite these costs, there is still a lot that we can learn from the history of invention. For example, some inventions were originally created for no other purpose than to solve a problem. Other inventions were made just for fun or as an experiment. But even the simplest inventions can have big consequences. For example, the Telephone was invented to make communication more efficient and cost-effective. Today, it plays an important role in our lives and economy.

There are several ways to help rise awareness about Invention and keep it alive.

Patent applications: What are the most popular patent applications?
Patent applications are one of the most popular types of patent filings. They are used to protect ideas and inventions that may not be protected by other types of patents, like trade secret protection. 
 There are many different types of patent applications, but the most popular ones include: 
-Patent application for a new product 
-Patent application for a process or structure 
-Patent application for an invention 
There is no set number of patent applications that are filed in any given year, but it is generally safe to assume that there will be at least one type of patent application filed every month. This makes Patents a very important part of any development team as they can protect ideas and inventions from being ripped off by others.

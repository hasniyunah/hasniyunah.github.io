What are big ideas?
Big ideas are important, but they can be hard to come by. Here are some tips on finding big ideas that will help you succeed: 
1. Define what you want your business to achieve. Once you have a clear idea of what your business wants to accomplish, it's easier to come up with ideas for how to achieve it. 
2. Think about who your target market is. Big businesses often think about their target market as all the people who are potential customers or employees who might be interested in their product or service. However, there are also many people out there who don't have a specific interest in your product or service, and you need to include them in your thinking while developing your big idea. 
3. Create a vision and mission statement.

Main Points: New ideas can improve things like productivity, happiness, and social interaction.
The research on new ideas screams out for change - and that’s where the concept of “personalization” comes in. Personalization is the process of creating unique, customized experiences for customers by adding their own personality traits or preferences to products or services.
There are a number of benefits to personalizing your products and services, from making them more engaging to improving customer satisfaction. But there are also a number of drawbacks, including increased costs and decreased efficiency. So how can you personalize your products and services to create the most efficient and profitable outcomes?

One way is to consider what features your customers would want added to your product or service. This can help you focus on what makes your customers happy, rather than trying to cater too much to everyone.

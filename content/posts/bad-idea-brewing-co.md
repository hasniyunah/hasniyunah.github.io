Inventing is often hailed as the key to success, but it's not always easy to come up with new ideas. Here are some tips for overcoming obstacles and generating invention ideas.
1. Brainstorm with a group of people. Collaboration can help spark new ideas and help you see problems from different angles.

3. Be persistent and don't give up.Search for solutions until you find one that works for you. Inventing is often a trial-and-error process, so don't be discouraged if your first few attempts fail.

2020: The year of the moon
Given that the moon is a natural satellite of Earth, it has been speculated for many years what could happen if human beings were to explore and land on the moon. And while 2020 is not necessarily the year that such a mission would be attempted, there are plenty of ideas out there for when such an endeavor could take place. Here are four examples: 
The first idea involves space travel to the moon by using a small spacecraft called Artemis. This spacecraft would be able to dock with a Russian Luna-15 spacecraft and release its astronauts in order to study the moon's surface. 
Another idea involves exploring space stations on the moon. These stations would provide research resources and rotating crews that could also conduct tasks like mining or robotic excavation. 
Lastly, we have another idea involving sending humans back down to the moon in an effort to change certain aspects of its environment.

Developing Ideas: How to take a good idea and make it great.
When it comes to developing ideas, the key is to start with a good foundation and then build upon it. Here are some tips on how to take a good idea and make it great:
1. Do your research. Make sure you have a solid understanding of the topic or issue you're trying to address. This will help you create a more well-rounded and thought-out solution.

2. Brainstorm with others. Collaborating with others can help you generate new ideas and perspectives that you may not have considered on your own.

3. Be open to feedback. Once you've got a few ideas down, solicit feedback from trusted friends or colleagues. Their input can help improve upon your initial concepts.

4. Take your time. Don't rush the process of developing your idea.

The definition of innovation
Innovation is the process ofimproving or creating a new product, service, or technology. Innovation occurs in all industries and can be found in anything from small businesses to large companies. In recent years, innovation has come under increasing scrutiny as it has been linked with the movement away from traditional methods and towards new ones. This shift has led to a redefinition of what innovation means, with some saying that it is more about creating value for others than just making a new product.

Idea 2: We need to create more opportunities for people to learn
There are many ways that people can learn new things. Some people learn through books, others through conversation, and still others through online resources. In order to create more opportunities for people to learn, we should consider creating more interactive learning experiences. These experiences could include:
-Teams: A team learning experience is a great way for students to work together and learn from one another.Team building activities can be used in a variety of ways, such asctoring lectures or discussing research papers with classmates.

-Video Lessons: Adding video lessons into classrooms can help students learn by watching it instead of reading it. This type of learning is convenient because students have time to stop and watch the lesson while they are working on other tasks.

-Blogs: Blogging can be a great way for students to share their ideas, thoughts, and experiences with others.

Historical overview: How has the definition of invention changed over time?
Invention has undergone many changes throughout history. Over time, the definition of what qualifies as an invention has varied, in large part due to the development of new technologies. Today, invention typically refers to any innovation that is not simply a modification or improvement on something that has been done before. This includes developments in fields such as engineering and technology, but also includes ideas and concepts that may never have been put into practice.
One of the most significant changes to the definition of invention occurred in the early 1800s, when advances in technology led to a proliferation of new ideas for products and services that could be called inventions. Prior to this period, most innovations were seen as improvements on existing concepts or methods. This changed with the introduction of steam power and other technologies that allowed for more complex machines and processes.

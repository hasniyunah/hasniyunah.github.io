How to Use Ideas: What are some tips for using your ideas effectively?
Ideas can be a great resource for problem solving and creativity. However, they can also be a powerful tool for blocking out distractions and focusing on the solution. Here are some tips to use your ideas effectively:
1.Think about what you want your idea to achieve. When you come up with an idea, try to think about what it could help achieve. This will help you focus on the task at hand and avoid getting lost in your thoughts.
2.Make sure your idea is feasible. Once you have brainstormed all of your ideas, make sure that they are still possible to turn into a reality. If there is any doubt whether or not an idea is feasible, talk to someone else about it first before coming up with any further ideas.
3.Be realistic about how much time it will take to get your idea off the ground.

The process of coming up with ideas: How does one go about coming up with ideas?
Ideas come in all shapes and sizes. Sometimes they are just a jumble of thoughts that don't make much sense together, but other times they might be something that someone has been staring at for months and hasn't had the guts to say anything about. 
No matter how ideas start out, the key is to keep talking to yourself and others about them. The more you share, the better you'll get at coming up with good ones.

They come in all shapes and sizes, but they all have one common goal: to make a real difference in the lives of others. And that’s what makes big ideas so essential – they can change the world, no matter what.

How to structure an idea: What are the steps?
Ideas are a powerful tool that can help you get started on anything. They can be used to create new businesses, plan new trips, or even come up with new ways of looking at old problems. However, there are a few key rules you need to follow in order to create great ideas.
The first step is to have a strong idea of what you want your business or trip to do. Once you know what you want, it's important to figure out the steps needed to get there. This will help you build an outline for your business or trip that is specific and accurate.

Next, it's important to make sure your idea is interesting and innovative. If your idea isn't interesting or innovative, people may not be interested in starting your business or going on your trip.

What are big ideas?
When it comes to big ideas, there are many dimensions to consider. These can be broken down into four categories: problem, solution, opportunity and impact. 
Problem: How can we make our world a better place? 
Solution: There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question; each person's perspective and situation will dictate the best way to solve a problem. However, there are a few general concepts that can be used in order to determine what type of solution may work best for a given situation. One such concept is called the "Golden Rule." This states that you should do what is right, even if it doesn't make sense at first. 

Opportunity: What are the possible consequences of our actions? 

Impact: What kind of change or impact will our solutions have?

How do we create new ideas?
Innovation is the process of creating new ideas. It can be found in everything from technology to business to creativity. Here are four ways to create new ideas:

1. Brainstorm with others: Brainstorming is a great way to get feedback and share your ideas with other people. You can also ask them for their opinion on a particular idea or topic.
2. Take on a challenge: Taking on a challenge is another way to create new ideas. Often, when you put yourself in an uncomfortable position, you’ll come up with better ideas than if you hadn’t taken the challenge.
3. Go beyond what people think is possible: Sometimes all it takes is going beyond what others think is possible to come up with better ideas.

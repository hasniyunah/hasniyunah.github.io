The value of feedback: How important is it to get feedback on ideas before they are implemented?
Feedback is an important part of any business. It can help you make sure your ideas are a good fit for the company, and it can help you improve your products or services. But getting feedback on ideas before they're implemented can be just as important. If you don't get feedback, you could end up implementing something that's not really what you wanted or was hoping for. Feedback can also help you learn how to improve your business model and improve the way your products and services are delivered. It's worth getting it, whether it's through surveys or informal conversations with employees.

The Future of Invention: We are in a golden age of invention and creativity.
Invention and creativity are at an all-time high. Innovation is the process of coming up with new ideas or solutions to old problems. It’s what has made us civilization as we know it. And it’s what will make us the best for the future.
The recent surge in innovation has been fueled by three main factors: technology, energy and human creativity. With technology getting ever better, more people are able to access new knowledge and ideas faster than ever before. This has led to a rise in innovation and creativity, which is only going to continue growing in the years ahead.

On the other hand, energy is becoming increasingly scarce, making it even harder for companies to come up with new ideas. But this isn’t stopping companies from trying – there are now dozens of startups that are using solar energy to create new products and services.

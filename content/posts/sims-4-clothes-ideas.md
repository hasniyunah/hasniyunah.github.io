2) Set up a work space on the bottom of your stairs
When it comes to work, having a space on the bottom of your stairs is a essential part of the equation. Not only does this give you more storage for your tools and materials, but it also creates a more comfortable environment for working. Here are two easy diy ideas that can help make your staircase work space even better:
1. Create an extra work area on the bottom step by installing a power drill, saw, screwdriver and other tools above the stair rail. This will make it easier to access everything you need without having to search through a pile of tools on top of your head.

2. Use old pieces of furniture (or hunt down some cheap Craigslistops) to create makeshift benches or tables. Simply staple pieces of plywood directly against the wall or use screws to hold them in place.

The Benefits of Innovation: Why are innovations successful? What are some common benefits?
Innovation is a process of exploring, testing and improving upon ideas. It has the potential to improve entire industries while making people's lives more comfortable and efficient. There are many benefits to innovation, including increased productivity, reduced costs, diverse product offerings and improved customer service.

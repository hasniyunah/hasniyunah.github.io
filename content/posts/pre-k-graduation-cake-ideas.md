One idea is to add a few shelves to the wall behind your TV or in the corner of the room where you keep your books, movies, and music.

A third idea is to create a small interior shrine to your favorite thing. This could be a pottery jar with one of your favorite pieces of art inside, a picture from your childhood that you miss dearly, or any other piece of memorabilia that makes you happy. If you have children, they can help you select items for the shrine. Another way to organize storage is by using bins.

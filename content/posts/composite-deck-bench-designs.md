what is innovation?
Innovation is the process of taking an idea and turning it into a reality. It can be something as simple as a new way to do something or a new product that solves a problem. Innovation is what allows us to progress as a society and make our lives better.
Without innovation, we would still be living in caves and eating raw meat. Innovation is what led to the creation of fire, which allowed us to cook food and stay warm. Innovation is also what led to the invention of the wheel, which made transportation much easier.

Innovation is not just about creating new things, but also about improving upon existing ideas. For example, the first cars were very crude and unreliable. But over time, through innovation, they became more reliable and efficient.

Innovation is essential for businesses to grow and compete in today’s global economy.

Marketing: How to market your invention idea
Assuming you have an invention idea and want to market it, there are a few key things to keep in mind. First, it's important to do your research and understand both the industry and your potential customers. Who is your target market? What needs does your product address? How does your product compare to other similar products on the market? Once you have a solid understanding of these things, you can begin developing a marketing strategy.
There are a number of ways to go about marketing your invention idea. One option is to sell directly to companies who may be interested in manufacturing or distributing your product. Another option is to work with an invention marketing firm who can help you patent and protect your idea and then market it to potential buyers. Whichever route you choose, be sure to put together a strong pitch that highlights the need for your product and how it benefits consumers.

With the new millennium coming to an end, it is important to rethink many of the big ideas that have been talked about in the past. One such idea is the idea of digital divide. This is the idea that there is a large gap in access to information and technology between wealthier and poorer countries.

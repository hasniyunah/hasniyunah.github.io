The definition of creativity: How does it differ from other definitions?
Creativity is a field that encompasses many different definitions, but all of them share one common goal: to produce something new. Whether it’s creativity in the creative process itself or what people mean when they use the word, creativity can be defined in many ways. 
There are many different ways to define creativity, but all of them outline four core concepts: 1) The ability to take inspiration from others and create something new; 2) The ability to come up with solutions that haven’t been tried before; 3) The willingness to experiment and try new things; and 4) The drive to learn and grow. 

The definition of creativity can be very different depending on who you ask, but all of these core concepts are key when examining how creativity is defined in the world.

Introduce the topic of invention.
Invention is the driving force behind progress. It has led to the creation of technologies that have made our lives easier and more enjoyable. It is a process that involves the generation of new ideas, the development of those ideas into a plan or prototype, and the testing and refinement of the prototype. Inventors are people who are able to see beyond the status quo and imagine something better. They are creative problem-solvers who are always looking for ways to improve upon existing products or create entirely new ones. The invention process can be long and arduous, but the rewards can be great. Those who are successful in inventing something that makes a difference in the world can achieve fame and fortune.

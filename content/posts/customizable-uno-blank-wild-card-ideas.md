What are some common creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be anything from new ways of looking at an old problem to reinventing the wheel. Here are five creative ideas that come to mind when thinking about creative ideas: 
1. Use discarded materials to create something new. For example, if you have a bunch of old cereal boxes lying around, go through them and discard any that are too large or bulky to use. Once you’ve eliminated the big ones, start stacking these in different positions to see what kind of shapes and designs emerge.
2. Try a new approach to an existing idea. If you’ve been using the same recipe for years, try using a different type of flour or sugar in your baking recipes. This will give your baking recipes a bit of a fresh start and make them more delicious overall.
3. Take advantage of unused space.

Benefits and challenges of innovation
Innovation is a dynamic process that can have both positive and negative consequences. Some of the benefits of innovation include increased productivity, reduced costs, and new products and services that are more efficient or effective. However, as with any dynamic process, there are also challenges associated with innovation that can lead to decreased success or even failure. These challenges can originate from the novelty of the invention itself, from the implementation of the invention into a business environment, or from the interactions between employees and customers who may be using the invention.

What makes a good idea?
Every idea has a differentiator and what makes a good one is always subjective. Some people might find the concept interesting, others might not. There are many factors to consider when choosing an idea, such as how well it will be executed, who will be using it, and whether it is something that users are already passionate about. 
One of the most important things to consider when coming up with ideas is whether or not they are big enough to warrant investment. If an idea is too small or unimportant to warrant attention, it will likely be forgotten or passed over. A good example of this was the iPhone app Gap which was only released in Australia but contained massive potential because users were already interested in fashion and had tonnes of feedback. Another example would be Square which was originally considered a payment platform but has since become a popular social media platform for businesses and individuals.

In the near future, we may see a world where computers and artificial intelligence (AI) are able to think for themselves. This would lead to opportunities for businesses and individuals to make more intelligent decisions without having to rely on a human intermediary. This could have a significant impact on many industries, including finance, healthcare, and manufacturing. One of the biggest questions that will need to be answered is how these technologies will be used and what implications they will have for the workforce.

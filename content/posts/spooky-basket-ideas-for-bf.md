Impact of innovation on society and economy:
Innovation is an ever-growing movement in the economy that leads to new products, services and businesses. It is also a key factor in society; innovations often lead to changes in social norms and the way people interact. The impact of innovation on society and economy has been studied for many years and there are some clear conclusions about what types of innovation have the biggest impact. 
One clear conclusion is that innovative activity can have a significant positive impact on society if it meets three conditions: it should be done in a way that does not harm others, it should be affordable for everyone, and it should be able to create jobs. However, even when innovations meet these conditions, they can still have a negative impact on society if they do not meet other specific requirements.

Origin of invention: How did somebody come up with the idea for a product or service?
Invention is a process of coming up with a new idea, or designing something that has not been done before. It can be anything from a simple invention to a groundbreaking product or service. The key to coming up with an innovative idea is to have an original solution that nobody else has come up with before. There are many different ways someone could come up with the idea for a product or service, and it all depends on what the person is trying to achieve. Some people come up with ideas while they are sleep, others work on them for months or even years before finally achieving success. However, the most important thing is that the person takes their time in coming up with an innovative solution.

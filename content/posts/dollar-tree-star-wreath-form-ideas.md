Tips for using creative ideas: How can you use your creativity to your advantage?
Creative ideas are a great way to come up with new and innovative ways to solve problems or create new products. However, there are a few things you can do to make sure that your creative ideas are successful:
1) Make sure that your ideas are original. Donâ€™t steal other peopleâ€™s ideas, or use old ideas without giving them a fresh start.
2) Use your imagination. When you come up with creative ideas, donâ€™t just think about what might work â€“ try out different scenarios and see what comes up.
3) Get feedback from others. Take the time to ask people who have experience with the product or problem youâ€™re thinking of solving how they would approach it. This will help you develop your idea into something that is both effective and appealing to potential customers.

The Pros and Cons: How do these new ideas compare and contrast with what is already known?
There are a lot of new ideas out there. Do you know what they all are? Let's take a look. 
One idea is to use technology to help improve education. Another is to create a more sustainable way of living. Plus, there are many more that have not been mentioned yet. So, how do these new ideas compare and contrast with what is already known?

Another difference between the new ideas and what has been done before is that some of the old solutions may not be as effective anymore or may not work as well anymore in the modern world.

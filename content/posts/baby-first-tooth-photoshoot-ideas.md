What is innovation and how does it differ from other types of creativity?
Innovation is a process of creating new ideas or products that solve a problem. It can come in many forms- from the invention of the telephone to the development of new drugs. 
One important difference between innovation and creativity is that innovation typically involves more than one person. In order to create something new, you need to come up with a solution that meets the needs of your audience and is unique to them. On the other hand, creativity often comes from within- people working on their own projects without any outside help. This type of creativity often produces more original ideas and products than those developed in collaboration.

Causes and Solutions: How can we improve our overall health by understanding why some things are causing us problems, and what can be done to fix them?
Every day, we make decisions that have an impact on our health and well-being. Unfortunately, not everyone understands why some things are causing them problems, and so they don't take the necessary steps to fix them. This lack of understanding can lead to a number of issues, including chronic pain, mental health issues, and even physical illness. To improve overall health, we need to understand the root causes of these problems and take the necessary steps to fix them. Here are five key ideas to help you do just that: 
1) Understand your triggers: every time you experience an unpleasant or stressful event (like getting a new job), your body releases chemicals like glutamate from the brains cells in response. These chemicals can cause pain signals to be sent directly to your brain stem.

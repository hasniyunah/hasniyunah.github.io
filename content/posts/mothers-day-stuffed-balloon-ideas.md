The 4 types of ideas: creative, critical, problem-solving, and emotional
Creative ideas are always intoxicating, and can be a great way to get your creative juices flowing. However, it's important to be careful with what you create – too much creativity can lead to problems. Here are four types of ideas that can help you get your creative juices flowing: problem-solving ideas, emotional ideas, and critical ideas.
Problem-solving Ideas: 
1) Come up with ways to make the existing structure of your business more efficient or effective. This could mean finding ways to cut costs or improve efficiency, or coming up with new ways to appeal to customers. 
2) Use your creativity in order to come up with solutions to problems that have been bothering your customers for years. For example, if you're a restaurant, come up with new menu items that appeal specifically to people who are struggling financially.

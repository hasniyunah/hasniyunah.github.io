What are creative ideas?
Creative ideas are a great way to get your creative juices flowing and come up with new solutions to problems. There are many different creative ideas out there, so you need to find the ones that fit your needs and interests. Here are some ideas to get started: 
-Create a petition: This is a great way to get people’s attention and show them how you feel about something. You can start by creating a simple Petition on change.org or any other website. Once you have made your case, offer anyone who will listen an argument for why they should change the policy. 

-Dare yourself: If you don’t know what you want or aren’t sure how to get started, take some risks and try something new. Take on an assignment or complete a project that isn’t immediately related to your current lifestyle.

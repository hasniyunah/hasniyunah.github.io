The power of inspiration: How can we use it to our advantage?
Inspiration is one of the most powerful tools we have. It can help us come up with new ideas, take on new challenges, and find solutions to problems. However, how can it be used to our advantage? Here are five ways: 
1) Get inspired by your surroundings: Check out your neighborhood, visit museums, or even watch movies to get a sense for what inspires you. This can help you come up with new ideas for projects or products. 
2) Use inspiration to create things you love: If youâ€™re a creative person, why not use your creativity to create things that you enjoy? Maybe you like making art or designing furniture, or you just enjoy spending time in nature. These activities can help give you an idea of what might inspire future projects.

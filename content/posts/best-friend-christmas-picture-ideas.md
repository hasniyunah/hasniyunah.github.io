The process of innovation
Innovation is the process of introducing something new into the market. This can be a new product, a new service, or a new way of doing things. Innovation is often driven by necessity, as companies look for ways to improve their products and services to meet the needs of their customers.
Innovation starts with an idea. This can come from anywhere – from within the company, from customers, or from outside sources. Once an idea has been identified, it must be developed and tested to see if it is feasible and will meet the needs of the target market. If it is successful, it will be launched into the market and become available to consumers.

Innovation is not easy, and it often takes many tries before a successful product or service is developed.

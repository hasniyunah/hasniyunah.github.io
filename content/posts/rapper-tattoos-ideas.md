Conclusion
The brainstorming process is a powerful tool that can help you come up with new ideas, solve problems, and think creatively. However, it's important to know when to use it and how to do it effectively. Here are a few tips on how to get the most out of your brainstorming sessions:
1. Set aside some time specifically for brainstorming. This will help you focus and not feel rushed.

2. Define the problem or goal you're trying to achieve. This will help you stay on track and not get sidetracked by tangential ideas.

3. Brainstorm with a group of people. This can help generate more ideas and provide different perspectives.

4. Don't be afraid to write down any and all ideas, no matter how silly they may seem at first glance.

How creativity impacts our lives
Creativity is a key factor that impacts our lives in many ways. Some say it’s the spark of inspiration that gets us going, while others say creativity comes from the willingness to take chances and work hard. Whatever the case may be, creativity has an impact on our lives in some way. 
For example, if you have a creative idea for a new product, you may be more likely to produce it if you are inspired by the prospect of making something new and different. Likewise, if you find yourself constantly searching for ways to improve your current work or business, then creativity may be one of your biggest assets. After all, it is through risk and experimentation that we learn how to create great things.

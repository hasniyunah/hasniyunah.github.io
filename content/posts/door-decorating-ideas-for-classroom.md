How do you come up with good ideas?
Ideas are a dime a dozen, but they often have the potential to be great. Here are three tips to come up with good ideas:
1. Take your time – don’t just give up on an idea right away. Start by thinking about it more closely and then coming up with potential ways that it could be improved.

2. Be open to feedback – If you don’t think your idea is good, ask other people for their opinions. This will help you get closer to the best version of your idea.

3. Be persistent – If you keep working on your idea, eventually it will become better.

This helps regulators ensure that innovative products and services are available for consumers as well as help businesses stay compliant with regulations.

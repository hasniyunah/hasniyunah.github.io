What is the definition of invention?
Invention is the process of coming up with a new product or service that never existed before. Invention can come from anything, from a simple idea to a novel technology. Some inventions are so important that they have led to entire industries, such as antibiotics and jet engines. Others are more mundane, like improved rice varieties or new ways to store gasoline. Regardless of the invention's importance, it is always amazing when someone comes up with a new way to do something.

2) Set up a work space on the bottom of your stairs
When it comes to work, having a space on the bottom of your stairs is a essential part of the equation. Not only does this give you more storage for your tools and materials, but it also creates a more comfortable environment for working. Here are two easy diy ideas that can help make your staircase work space even better:
1. Create an extra work area on the bottom step by installing a power drill, saw, screwdriver and other tools above the stair rail. This will make it easier to access everything you need without having to search through a pile of tools on top of your head.

2. Use old pieces of furniture (or hunt down some cheap Craigslistops) to create makeshift benches or tables. Simply staple pieces of plywood directly against the wall or use screws to hold them in place.

Ideas can be everything, or nothing. They can be new ways of looking at things, or old ways of looking at things that have been forgotten. Ideas are what make the world go round. They can be the spark that sets off a fire in someone’s mind and make them want to try something new, or they can be the inspiration for a new idea that someone has for the first time.

What are the steps involved in brainstroming?
There is no one single approach to brainstroming, but some key steps include: 1. Defining your problem or issue. This will help you to develop a clear understanding of what needs to be done in order to solve it. 2. Finding the right resources and materials. Once you have defined your issue, you will need to find the right people or resources who can help you with your solution. 3. Going ahead with your plan and working towards success. Once you have identified the necessary resources and cleared up any misunderstandings, it is important to push forward with your plan and work towards achieving a goal. 4. Taking action and following through with your plan. Finally, make sure that you take concrete steps towards achieving your goal and that you stay on track throughout the process.

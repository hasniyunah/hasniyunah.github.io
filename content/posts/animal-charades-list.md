Creativity in the arts: What makes art creative?
Creativity in the arts has been around for centuries, with different techniques and approaches used to achieve it. One of the key elements that makes art creative is the ability to see things differently and come up with new ideas. There are many different ways to be creative, and each one has its own strengths and weaknesses. Here are five of the most common ways artists are able to be creative: 
1. Drawing: Drawing is often seen as a passive process, with artists only using pencils and paper to create drawings. However, drawing can also be interactive, with artists using their imagination to create new drawings.

2. Painting: Painting is often seen as an active process, where artists use paintbrushes, palette knives, and other tools to create paintings. Paintings can be large or small, and they can be filled with color or without any color at all.

Origins of invention: How did people come up with ideas for new things?
The origins of many inventions can be traced back to the dawn of human civilization. For example, the wheel was first invented by a man named Eratosthenes in 384 BC. Other inventions that have had a lasting impact include the printing press and television. 
One of the most important factors in the development of invention is creativity. People are often inspired to come up with new ideas when they see something that they want to change or improve upon. This is why it is so important for people to get involved in the creative process and share their ideas with others.

Conclusion: What are the benefits and limitations of creativity?
Creativity is an essential part of any creative person’s life. It can help people come up with ideas for new products, services, or projects. But it can also be used to create problems and challenges. For example, creativity can help people come up with new ways to save money on their groceries. However, creativity can also be used to create problems that cannot be solved by common methods. For example, creativity can help people come up with new ways to prevent traffic accidents. However, the effectiveness of creativity has been limited by its limitations.

What are big ideas?
Big ideas are important, but they can be hard to come by. Here are some tips on finding big ideas that will help you succeed: 
1. Define what you want your business to achieve. Once you have a clear idea of what your business wants to accomplish, it's easier to come up with ideas for how to achieve it. 
2. Think about who your target market is. Big businesses often think about their target market as all the people who are potential customers or employees who might be interested in their product or service. However, there are also many people out there who don't have a specific interest in your product or service, and you need to include them in your thinking while developing your big idea. 
3. Create a vision and mission statement.

How innovation effects businesses: It can lead to new products, services, or processes that make a company more competitive and successful.
Innovation has been a key driver of business success for centuries. For most businesses, innovation is about creating new products, services, or processes that make a company more competitive and successful. However, innovation can also lead to changes in how a company does its work that can have significant impacts on its competitive position and overall performance.
For example, imagine you are a business that sells products made from natural materials. As the world becomes increasingly polluted and health hazards increase, your products may not be enough to meet the needs of your customers. To stay competitive, you may need to find new ways to produce and sell your products using more sustainable materials.

Similarly, when it comes to research and development (R&D), businesses often face stiff competition from rivals who are better equipped to conduct innovative research and develop new products quickly.

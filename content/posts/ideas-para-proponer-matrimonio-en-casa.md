What is an invention?
There is no one definitive definition of an invention, but most Americans would likely say that an invention is a new product, process, or service.  Inventors often work on their inventions for years before they finally create a product or service that people can use. 
There are many different types of inventions, but some common ones include technological advances like the Telephone, Telegraph and Radio Act of 1847 (TCR), which gave us the ability to talk to each other over the air; and health advances such as aspirin and insulin in the 1800s. 

Inventions can have a profound impact on society and the economy. For example, TCR allowed for easier travel and communication across country boundaries. This made it possible for people from all corners of the world to meet and share ideas. Similarly, insulin helped people with diabetes control their medications more effectively.

Origins of creativity: The human brain's ability to come up with new ideas.
Creativity has a long and mysterious history. Scientists have been trying to understand its origins for decades, but there is still much to learn about how creativity evolved. There are several theories about how creativity comes about, but one of the most popular is the “genetic lottery” theory. This theory posits that creativity emerges from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Other theories focus on the role of the hippocampus, which is tucked deep inside the brainstem. The hippocampus helps us remember new ideas and can be important in helping us come up with new solutions to problems. While there is still much to learn about how creativity works, these theories offer some interesting insights into its origins.

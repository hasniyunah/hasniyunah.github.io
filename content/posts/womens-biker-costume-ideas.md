- Get out of our comfort zones: Challenging ourselves with new experiences and ideas helps to stimulate creativity.

- Be open-minded: Approaching life with curiosity and an open mind allows for greater creativity.

What is a quality idea?
Quality is a key word in any business, and when it comes to ideas, it’s no different. Quality ideas are ones that can be improved upon and that could lead to increased profits for the business. Here are four ways to create quality ideas:
1. Develop a unique selling proposition (USP) for your business. This is the main thing that will differentiate your product or service from those of your competitors. It should be clear, concise, and easy to understand for customers who are looking for something new and different.

2. Offer discounts or special deals on your products or services. This will entice customers to come into your store or office and buy what you have to offer. It also helps keep customers around longer since they know that you’ll be offering something of value in return for their money.

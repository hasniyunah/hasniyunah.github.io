Conclusion: Sum up the main points of the article.
Creativity is not a talent that you are born with, it is a skill that can be learned. Anyone can be creative, it just takes some practice. Here are a few tips to help you get started:
1. Don't be afraid to experiment. Trying new things is the only way to find out what works for you.

2. Be open to new ideas. You never know where your next great idea will come from.

3. Don't worry about being perfect. The goal is to have fun and see what you can create, not to create something perfect.

4. Take inspiration from everywhere. Look at the world around you and find things that inspire you.

5. Keep a creative journal. Use it as a place to record your ideas, no matter how big or small they may be.

Progress monitoring: How can we track our progress and see how much more we can do?
Progress monitoring has always been a critical part of any project. However, as the world becomes more and more complex, it is even more important to keep track of what we are doing and how far we've come. This can be done through tools like project management software or a progress tracker app. Here are some big ideas for progress monitoring: 
1. Keep track of our work progress using project management software: Project management software can help us keep track of all of our tasks and milestones, as well as their status. This way, we can see how much we have accomplished and where we stand. 
2. Use a progress tracker app: Progress tracking apps help us keep track of our progress on a daily or weekly basis. This way, we can see whether we are on track to reach our goals or not.

Sustainable development: How can we make sure our planet will always be able to support us?
Sustainability is a key term in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) of the United Nations. The SDG are a set of goals that address global issues such as climate change, poverty, inequality, and health. The slogan for theSDG is “A world that works for all”.
There are many ways to make sure our planet will always be able to support us: by reducing our carbon footprint, creating jobs and businesses that are environmentally friendly, investing in renewable energy sources, and promoting healthy lifestyles.

Reducing our carbon footprint can be done through things like using less energy or buying power from solar or wind farms. Creating jobs and businesses that are environmentally friendly can be done by improving transportation infrastructure or creating products that are sustainable.

Economic Applications of Invention
Invention has a broad range of economic applications, from making new products to improving the efficiency of businesses. Inventions can also have a significant impact on the economy as a whole, depending on their potential uses and impacts. Here are some examples: 
1. Invention can help improve the quality of products. For example, an invention that makes products more healthy or less risky could lead to increased sales and reduce risks associated with manufacturing processes. 
2. Invention can help increase efficiency in businesses. For example, an invention that makes it easier to track expenses or get information from suppliers could lead to faster delivery times and reduced costs for businesses. 
3. Invention can create new markets for products or services. For example, an invention that creates a new type of clothing could bring in new customers and make it more difficult for rivals to compete against him/her.

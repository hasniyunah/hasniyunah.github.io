Big Ideas are the driving force behind much of the progress that has been made throughout history. They are responsible for some of the greatest inventions, discoveries, and works of art. A Big Idea can be anything that inspires someone to think outside the box and come up with a new way of doing things. Sometimes, a Big Idea is something that seems so simple and obvious in hindsight, but it takes someone with a unique perspective to see it.

The risks and benefits of implementing big ideas.
Big ideas are important for businesses and individuals because they can help make large changes in how we live, work, and spend our time. However, implementation of big ideas can be risky and difficult. Here are four key dangers to avoid:
1. Losing sight of the goal: When a business or individual begins to focus on implementing a big idea, they may forget the main reason they created the idea in the first place- to make a difference in people’s lives. Once theirmain objective has been achieved (and often not easily), they may start thinking about other things instead of delivering on their original promise.

2. Failing to deliver on expectations: Big ideas often involve significant changes that could have a significant impact on both people and businesses if not executed flawlessly.

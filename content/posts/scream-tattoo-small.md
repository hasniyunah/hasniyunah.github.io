What is innovation?
Innovation is the creation of new ideas that replace or improve on the existing product, service, or system. Innovation can come from a small idea that’s implemented quickly, or it can come from a big idea that’s tackled in an effort to improve a whole product line. It can also come from the combination of two ideas, or from something new that isn’t even possible before. Innovation is something that every company needs to consider when they create their products and services.

2022: What are the new ideas for businesses in 2022?
There are many new ideas for businesses in 2022, including ones that focus on digital marketing, artificial intelligence, and reconfiguration of workforces. Some of the most promising concepts include: 
1. The rise of "Intelligent Manufacturing" - companies that use machine learning and algorithms to optimize production runs and produce more quickly and cheaply. This could lead to a significant increase in jobs in the manufacturing sector, as well as a decrease in the need for human labor. 
2. How AI is changing the way we interact with our environment - through things like 3D printing or autonomous vehicles. These changes could have serious implications for businesses, as they could create new opportunities for cost overruns, bottlenecks, and performance problems.

Different brainstorming techniques
When it comes to brainstorming, there is no one-size-fits-all approach. The best way to brainstorm depends on the situation and the type of project you’re working on. Here are three different brainstorming techniques to try:
1. Brainwriting

Brainwriting is a great option when you need to generate a lot of ideas quickly. To brainwrite, each person in the group writes down their ideas on a piece of paper. Then, everyone passes their paper to the person next to them, who adds their own ideas. This continues until everyone has had a chance to add to all of the ideas.

2. Round Robin

The round robin technique is similar to brainwriting, but with one key difference: instead of passing around a piece of paper, each person takes turns verbally sharing their ideas with the group.

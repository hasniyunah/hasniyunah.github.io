Conclusion: Tips for turning your creative ideas into tangible results.
Creative ideas can be turned into tangible results with a little effort and creativity. Here are some tips to help get started: 
1. Take a step back and think about the original idea. Are you brainstorming with others to come up with new ideas? If so, take the time to answer these two questions: What is the main benefit of this idea? And is there someone who would benefit from this idea? 
2. Look at what you have already done in your creative process. Have you ever had an idea but never put it into action? Try doing something similar first and see what works best for you. This can also include coming up with a prototype or model of the idea before starting anything else. 
3. Get organized and start thinking about how you plan on implementing this idea.

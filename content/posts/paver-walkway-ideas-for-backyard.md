Creative juices: How creativity flows through our veins
Creativity is one of the most powerful forces in our lives. It can help us see things in a new way, inspire us to create, and connect with others. But just how creativity flows through our veins? And what role does it play in our lives?
According to a study by University of Edinburgh researchers, creativity is passed down from parents to children through their blood pressure levels. When the parents had high blood pressure levels, they were more creative than when they had low blood pressure levels. This finding suggests that creativity is a natural part of human nature and can be passed down through the generations.

Other studies have also shown that creativity is connected with stress levels. If people are under stress, they are less creative than if they are not under stress. This suggests that stress can influence how creative we become.

Business models: How to make an invention successful?
Invention ideas are a dime a dozen, but the ones that work can be very profitable. Here are four tips on how to make your invention successful:
1. Choose the right business model: Any invention should have a specific business model in mind before you can begin developing it. Make sure that your business is able to pay off its investment, generate income, and attract customers.

2. Get market saturation: Once your invention has reached a certain level of popularity, it will be more difficult to switch it to another business model. To get market saturation, make sure that your product or service is well-received by a wide range of people. This can include both potential customers and competitors.

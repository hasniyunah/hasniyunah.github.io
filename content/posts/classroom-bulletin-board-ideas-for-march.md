Technology Transfer: What are some ways that an inventor can get new technology licensed, patented, or developed into a real product?
Inventors often need to get new technology licensed, patented, or developed into a real product in order to make a profit. There are many ways that an inventor can do this. Some ways include: 
1. Contact companies who make access to new technology difficult. This could be done by contacting companies who make it difficult for others to get access to new technology, such as those who control the patents and copyrights for the technology. 
2. Contact tech companies who make it difficult for others to bring new technology to market. These tech companies might include those that produce computer viruses, those that produce software that is difficult to uninstall, or those that make it difficult for others to find information about new technologies. 
3. Get involved with technical societies and technology groups who specialize in promoting new technologies.

How to create a positive customer experience
Creating a positive customer experience is not only important for your business, but also for your own personal satisfaction. Here are some tips to help make your customer experience more positive:
1. Keep your customers close by. When possible, keep your customers close to you and give them personalized service. This will create a feeling of warmth and connection with you, which will make them want to come back.

2. Be patient. Don't take things too quickly or you'll lose the trust of your customers. Instead, work slowly and steadily to build up a relationship with them. This will give you time to understand them and learn their needs.

3. Make sure you're listening attentively. Not only do it show that you care about what they have to say, but it can also help improve the quality of conversations when trying to sell something or provide support.

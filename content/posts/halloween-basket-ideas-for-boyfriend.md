Why do we have them?: how do they originate?
Most of us have had ideas. Some of us have had great ideas, others less so. But where do these ideas come from? How do they originate?
Ideas can come from anywhere and everywhere. They can come from our own minds, or from the minds of other people. They can come from books, movies, or even just casual conversations.

Ideas can also originate from our experiences. We might have a new idea after experiencing something for the first time, or after seeing someone else experience it. Or we might have an idea that comes to us in a dream.

There is no one answer to where ideas come from. They can come from anywhere and anyone. The important thing is what we do with them once we have them.

The Conclusion:
Over the past few years, a number of new ideas have arisen in the area of quantum mechanics. Some of these ideas are more theory-oriented than others, but they all have one thing in common: They offer a way to explain how some everyday objects can be in two or more states at the same time. This has big implications for everything from physics to engineering to computer science.

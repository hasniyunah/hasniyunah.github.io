Creative tools: What are they?
Creative tools, or tools that can help you be creative, are anything from a tool to help you brainstorm ideas to software that can help with creating art or designs. Here are 8 of the most common creative tools:
1. A spiral notebook – A spiral notebook is perfect for colorful and innovative ideas, as well as for taking sketches and ideas to paper. You’ll love using a spiral notebook as your creative tool because it makes it easy to jot down ideas and keep track of what you’ve been working on. Plus, Spiral notebooks are great for organized creativity because they come in different sizes and widths.

2. A whiteboard – A whiteboard is another great way to get started in your creative process. Just like spiral notebooks, whiteboards come in different shapes and sizes so you can find one that fits your needs perfectly.

Unfortunately, not everyone understands why some things are causing them problems, and so they don't take the necessary steps to fix them. This lack of understanding can lead to a number of issues, including chronic pain, mental health issues, and even physical illness. To improve overall health, we need to understand the root causes of these problems and take the necessary steps to fix them. Here are five key ideas to help you do just that: 
1) Understand your triggers: every time you experience an unpleasant or stressful event (like getting a new job), your body releases chemicals like glutamate from the brains cells in response. These chemicals can cause pain signals to be sent directly to your brain stem.

The creative process: How does one go about creating something new?
Creativity is a process that some people enjoy and others find difficult. The creative process can be broken down into four main categories: 1) Brainstorming 2) Idea generation 3) Implementation 4) Delivery. In order to be creative, one must have an idea and be able to come up with creative ways to express that idea. Additionally, one must have the courage to take risks in order to create something new. Lastly, creativity can only come from within.

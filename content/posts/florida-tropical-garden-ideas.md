What are some common mistakes people make when starting a blog?
There are a few common mistakes people make when starting a blog, and the most important thing is to be aware of them so that you don’t make them. Here are some mistakes to watch out for:
1. Not knowing what you want your blog to say. When you first set up your blog, it might seem like a great idea to just post whatever is on your mind. But if you don’t really know what you want your blog to achieve, then it will likely fail. So start by planning out what your goals are and focus on hitting those goals rather than just posting anything without knowing why or how it will help you achieve those goals.

2. Not having a clear strategy for growth. One of the best ways to ensure that your blog does well is to have a solid strategy for growing it over time.

Citation: How should an inventor be cited?
An inventor should be cited when creating or referencing a work in any form, whether it be in an academic article, book, thesis, or patent application. Citing an inventor correctly can improve the accuracy and legibility of your work, as well as prevent others from plagiarizing your invention. To properly cite an inventor, follow these simple steps:
1. Identify the inventor(s) responsible for your invention. This can be done by finding their name and contact information on patents or other sources that list inventors.

2. Research the specific invention you are referencing to try to determine which author wrote about that invention specifically. If you're referencing a work written by several authors, it's often helpful to identify which author wrote about each innovation in order to better understand how they could have been cited for this particular innovation.

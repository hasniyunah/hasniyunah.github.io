Tools and Materials: What kind of tools or materials do you need to complete a project?
When starting a project, there are always different tools and materials needed. However, depending on the project you are working on, different tools and materials might be necessary.  For example, when building a house, you may need some tools to build the wall or home.  Additionally, if you are doing a project that requires welding or other heavy-duty work, you will need some special tools or materials to complete the task.   A project also depends on the type of tool or material used. For example, building a car may require metalworking tools like hammers and saws to cut through wood. Alternatively, painting may require a paintbrush and roller.

Requirements for innovation
Innovation is essential to the success of businesses and societies. However, some challenges companies face when it comes to innovation include:
-Lack of creativity: Many companies find it difficult to come up with new ideas. This is due in part to the rigid methods that are typically used in business. For example, most businesses have a traditional model where products are produced one after the other. This system limits the potential for creativity and producesfewer new ideas.

-Disruption: When a new idea comes along, many companies are hesitant to adopt it because they think it would be too expensive or hard to replicate. However, disruption is often what allows businesses to take risks and innovate new models.

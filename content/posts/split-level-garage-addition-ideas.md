How to create good ideas: What should you do to create great ideas?
Creating great ideas starts with having good ideas. There are a number of things you can do to help get started, but the most important thing is to keep focused. The most important thing is to be consistent in your efforts and not give up on your projects. There are a few things that will help you get started:
1. Engineering your thinking: This is the process of coming up with solutions and concepts that are novel and unique. It’s important to have a clear understanding of what you want to achieve, and then engineering your thinking in order to come up with innovative solutions.

2. Be persistent: Be persistent in trying new things and keeping an eye on your goals. If you’re not constantly pushing yourself, you will eventually give up and become bored with your work or the project itself.

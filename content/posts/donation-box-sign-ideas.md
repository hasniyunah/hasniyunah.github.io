Invention as an event: What are some of the key steps in invention?
Invention is the process of coming up with a new product or idea. It can be something as simple as making a new recipe for cooking or designing a new shirt. The key to invention is coming up with an original concept that others can't come up with. There are many steps involved in coming up with a new product, but one of the most important is creating an idea. Once you have an idea, it's important to find someone who can help you develop it into a reality.

How did invention ideas come about?
Invention ideas come about when two people think of the same idea and come up with a plan to make it a reality. Invention ideas can come from anywhere, but often they start with an idea that someone has had before. Sometimes an idea is just too good to be true, but often the realisation that it could be used in a product or service makes it all the more appealing. For example, there was once a man who came up with the idea for a computer game called "Pac-Man". This game would help children learn about mathematics and science, something that was sorely lacking in their schools at the time. Another example is the invention of the telephone. Many people at first thought it couldn't be used because it was so big and expensive, but soon realised that it could be turned into a valuable tool for communication.

Gadgets: How to use your new gadgets safely, making the most of your new phone or tablet, and how to take care of your batteries.
If you're a gadget lover, then you know that it's important to take care of your new devices. One way to do this is by using caution when using them. You should also be aware of the different types of batteries that are available and how to charge them safely. Here are some tips on how to use your new gadgets safely: 
1) Use the device's battery saver feature When you first get your phone or tablet, it may have an option called "battery saver." This will help extend the life of your battery by shutting off some features automatically. 

2) Keep your phone or tablet safe When you're not using it, keep your device in a safe place. This could be either a cardboard box or an envelope with padded edges.

what are big ideas?
What are Big Ideas?
In education, a big idea is a broad concept that provides a unifying structure for a lesson or unit. It helps students connect new information to what they already know and understand. Big ideas should be open-ended and complex, allowing students to explore them in depth.

Big ideas help students see the world in new ways and make connections between different concepts. They encourage higher-level thinking and promote deeper understanding. When students can articulate the big ideas in a subject, they have mastered the essential content and skills.

Repainting a Room: Tips and tricks for painting a room successfully.
If you’re looking to spruce up your living room or bedroom, there are a few easy tricks to help out. Here are a few tips to repaint your room successfully:
1) Start with the basics: Paint the walls first and then the ceiling. This will give your painting project a more unified feel.

2) Use a light color for each area of the room: If you want your walls to be in one color, use that color in all of your walls. If you want your ceilings and floors to be different colors, start with one color and add other shades as needed.

3) Don’t forget about trim: Wipe down any debris that may have built up on the wallpapers or flooring, and try to get rid of any excess paint.

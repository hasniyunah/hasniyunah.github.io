Concepts behind plot and story: What are the elements of a good story?
Plot is the story's backbone, and without a plot, stories are essentially empty vessels. Storytelling has been around for centuries, and there are dozens of different concepts that contribute to a good story. Here are a few key ones:
1) Characters: What makes a good character? Is he or she likable, believable, and relatable? Are they in control of their own lives and choices? Are they interesting enough to follow along with the story?

2) Plot: How does the story go from start to finish? Is it chronological, or does it go in reverse or hops around like an L.A. law student on a bender? Are there any side stories that play into the main plotline? And how important is the climax/ending to the story?

In his article "Brainstroming: How Our Nerves Play a Vital Role in Thought and Action," (published in the journal "The Journal of Neuroscience"), Dr. Konrad Lorenz, a professor at the University of Vienna, suggested that our brains are actually two organs working in unison. He argued that the two systems work together to form a brainstrom, or group of integrated circuits. This group is what allows us to think and act effectively.

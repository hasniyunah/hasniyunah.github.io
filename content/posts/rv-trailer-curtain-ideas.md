Definition of invention:
Invention definitions vary by country, so it's important to define what an invention is before discussing it in further detail. In the United States, for example, an invention is a new product or service that has never been produced before. Inventions can be made from anything from scratch, to a variation on existing technology. They can even come from ideas someone had while brainstorming during their day job.

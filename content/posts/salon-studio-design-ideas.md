Definition of innovation: How does it differ from other types of innovation?
When it comes to innovation, there are a few key differences that can be observed. For one, innovation is not just about coming up with new ideas or products; it also includes taking risks and trying something new in order to create something better. This is what makes innovation so important – it allows companies to constantly improve their products and services while also taking advantage of new opportunities.
But the main difference between innovation and other types of innovation is that innovation is not always about money. In fact, some people argue that innovation should only be considered when it creates value for society as a whole – otherwise, it’s just called “innovation” by those in the business world. However, this doesn’t mean that there isn’t always a cost associated with innovative work – in fact, there often is.

What is an invention?
There is no one definitive definition of an invention, but most Americans would likely say that an invention is a new product, process, or service.  Inventors often work on their inventions for years before they finally create a product or service that people can use. 
There are many different types of inventions, but some common ones include technological advances like the Telephone, Telegraph and Radio Act of 1847 (TCR), which gave us the ability to talk to each other over the air; and health advances such as aspirin and insulin in the 1800s. 

Inventions can have a profound impact on society and the economy. For example, TCR allowed for easier travel and communication across country boundaries. This made it possible for people from all corners of the world to meet and share ideas. Similarly, insulin helped people with diabetes control their medications more effectively.

Types of creativity: Presentation, Idea, Solution, Legacy
Creativity is a vast and ever-changing field. The following are three types of creativity: presentation, idea, and solution. Presentation creativity is the ability to create an effective and catchy presentation that stands out from the competition. Idea creativity is the invention of new solutions to problems that have been faced before. Solution creativity comes in handy when there is no existing solution that can be found. It is the creative rendering of a problem into a solved entity. Legacy creativity is the retention of your ideas after they are finished, whether it be for future use or just to keep them safe and stored away in your brain for future reference.

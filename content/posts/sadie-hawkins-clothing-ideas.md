How to get started with creative ideas: What should you do first?
Creative ideas are a key part of any business or creative project. However, getting started can be difficult. Here are four tips to help you get started:
1. Look at your goals 
First, ask yourself what kind of creativity you want to achieve. Do you want to create new ideas, or simply improve on old ones? If your answer is "both," look for ways to combine your two skills. Are you interested in creating products, services, or designs? Then look into Lynda.com and online resources such as Illustrator and Photoshop for help.
2. Get organized 
Once you have a basic idea of what you want to accomplish, it's time to start thinking about how to achieve it. Try creating a timeline/schedule for your project and working with someone else who can help guide you along the way.

The different types of creative art
There are many different types of creative art. Some people may think of art as paintings in a museum, while others may think of it as the music they listen to on the radio. Creative art can be anything that someone creates that is intended to be beautiful or expressive. Here are some of the different types of creative art:
Painting: Painting is one of the most popular forms of creative art. People have been painting for centuries, and there are many different styles and techniques that can be used. If you're interested in painting, you can learn about different brushstrokes and color theory to create beautiful works of art.

Sculpture: Sculpture is another popular form of creative art. Unlike painting, sculpture is three-dimensional, so it can be touched and interacted with.

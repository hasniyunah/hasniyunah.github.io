What is the best way to approach new ideas?
New ideas are always something to be taken with a grain of salt, but there are a few things that can help make them more palatable. One approach is to ask yourself what the potential benefits of the idea are. If you can find an example of how the idea could be used in your field or business, it can help make it more palatable. Another thing to keep in mind is that new ideas should not be taken lightly - if they seem too good to be true, they probably are. However, by taking a step back and investigating the potential benefits, you can form a better opinion of whether or not this is something that would work for you.

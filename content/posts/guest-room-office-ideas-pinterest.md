The power of creativity: What makes creative ideas so powerful?
Creativity is a key ingredient in any successful business or organization. When it comes to creativity, there are three elements that have to be in place: an idea, a plan, and execution. Without these three elements, your creativity will be limited. 
The power of creativity comes from the combination of these three elements. If you can combine different ideas and come up with a plan that works, then your creativity will be amplified. But if you lack the creativity needed to come up with a great plan, then your ideas will be less powerful and less likely to work. 

The best way to increase your creativity is by practicing it regularly. This means learning how to come up with new ideas and coming up with plans that work well. When you have both the idea and the plan in place, your creativity will be at its highest level!

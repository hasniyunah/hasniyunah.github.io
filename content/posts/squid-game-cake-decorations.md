4. The finished Product: How does the finished product stack up against other options?
When looking at options for homebuilding, it can be hard to decide which one is the best for you. Whether you're looking to start a home from scratch or just update an existing one, there are a number of different options available. 
One option is to go with a pre-made home. These homes come pre-assembled and can be used in a variety of ways. Some people find them easy to use and others find them more difficult to work with. The final product will likely vary based on the person's preferences.

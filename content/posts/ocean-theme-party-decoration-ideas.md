What is brainstroming?
Brainstroming is a mental activity that occurs when a person is focused on one thing and does not have other thoughts or concerns running through their minds. Brainstroming can be beneficial to someone, as it can help them to focus on a task and stay organized. However, it can also be harmful to someone if they do not take breaks throughout the day or if they are too focused on their work.

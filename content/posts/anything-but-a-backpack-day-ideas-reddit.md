The main points of the article
1. Ideas can be put into many different categories, but the three most common are: problems, solutions, and potential solutions.
2. Solutions to problems are often the easiest to find, and often have obvious solutions. However, there may be multiple possible solutions that fit the problem and still meet the goals of the solution.

3. Potential solutions are more difficult to determine, but can provide a more complete or accurate solution than either a solution or a problem. They can also be less likely to cause further problems down the road.

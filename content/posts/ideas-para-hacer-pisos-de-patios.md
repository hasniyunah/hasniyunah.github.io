Creative expressions: What are they and how do they differ from regular expressions?
Creative expressions are different from regular expressions in that they make use of the imagination to create new and unique sentences. They can be used to match text against a set of specific criteria, or to identify patterns in text.
While regular expressions are widely used in text Morgan Kaufmann offers a number of creative expression tools to help you create more interesting and innovative sentences. These tools can be found on the left-hand side of the main Morgan Kaufmann page, under “Creative Expression”.

Conclusion: How to be creative and use creativity to your advantage
Creativity is an essential part of any creative person’s arsenal. By using creativity to your advantage, you can become a more successful artist, writer, or musician. Here are a few tips to help you be more creative:
1. Take time for yourself – when you’re not working on something, take some time for yourself and do something that you love. This will help get your mind off of work and give you an opportunity to think about what you want to create.

2. infrastructure – keep your studio or workspace well-maintained so that it’s easy to produce great artwork. This means having space for work, having high-quality tools and equipment, and having enough storage space to hold your materials.

Creative writing:
Creative writing is a process of coming up with new and unique ideas for stories and novels. It can be quite fun to come up with new plots, characters, and settings, and to see what different people think of your work. However, it can also be difficult to make your ideas come alive in a way that makes them interesting and engaging reading experience. Here are some tips on how to get started in creative writing: 
1. Make sure you have a clear vision for your story. Once you have an idea for what you want your story to be, it’s important to make sure that the story fits within that vision. If you don’t have a solid plan for how your story will play out, it may end up becoming something that’s far from interesting or engaging reading experience. 

2. Be patient.

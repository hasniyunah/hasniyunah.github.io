What will be the impact of artificial intelligence and machine learning on society?
As the world moves closer to artificial intelligence and machine learning becoming more commonplace, society will face various changes. One of the most significant changes will be how work and life is organized. currently, many people are employed through their companies or by working off of a job contract. With the rise of AI and machine learning, this system could change completely. Instead of having someone employed by their company for a certain amount of time, people may instead be hired as “artificial intelligence assistants” or “machine learning experts”. This would change the way we interact with our machines, as well as how work is done. Additionally, businesses will have to adjust their business models in order to keep up with this new technology.

What are some bad ideas?
New ideas can be a good thing, or a bad thing depending on how they're executed. Here are some bad ideas that could lead to negative outcomes: 
1. A new law that restricts freedom of speech. This law could lead to people being arrested and/or fined for expressing their opinions out of fear of retribution from the government. 
2. A plan to close all schools in the city in order to provide more public education. This plan would deprive children of instruction and would lead to an increase in crime rates in the city. 
3. Requiring businesses owners to install security cameras inside their businesses in order to catch thieves and criminals. This would require owners to spend money on something that isn't necessary and would also create an inconvenience for customers who need access to their businesses without having their business broken into.

The benefits of creative art: what are they?
Creative art has many benefits for both individuals and society. Here are some of the most common: 
1) It can help improve mental health. People who are creative often have more balanced lives than those who are not, and this is especially true when it comes to their mental health. They may find it easier to cope with stress and anxiety, and they may be less likely to suffer from depression or bipolar disorder.
2) It can help people learn new skills. People who are creative often develop new skills that they would not otherwise be able to use. This is especially true for people who are good at problem-solving or creating things from scratch. These skills can then be put to use in other areas of life, such as in the workplace or in hobbies.
3) It can help people connect with others.

Creative ideas: What are some good ways to come up with new ideas?
Creative ideas can come in many forms, but the most common way to come up with new ideas is through brainstorming. This is a process where you take whatever you think of and turn it into a plan. Once you have a plan, it's time to start thinking about how to put your ideas into practice. Here are some helpful tips for coming up with creative ideas:
1) Start with small concepts. When you have a lot of Ideas, it can be difficult to filter them all down into something that will work well. Smaller concepts are easier to think about and can be implemented quickly.

2) Take things one step at a time. When you're brainstorming, it's important to try and keep everything in mind at the same time so that you don't get overwhelmed. Instead, focus on one or two main ideas and go from there.

Types of creativity: Visual, auditory, kinaesthetic, and gestural.
Creativity is a two-fold process. There are creative visual and auditory experiences, as well as creative gestural experiences. Gestural creativity refers to the ability to create unique or innovative designs through the use of gestures. Gestural creativity can be seen in artists such as Michelangelo and Vincent van Gogh, who were known for their innovation in artistry. Visual creativity is when an artist creates a piece of art by using their eyesight and vision. This can be seen in paintings such as Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa, Caravaggio’s The Nude Descending from the Cross, and Picasso’s Guernica. Artists use their eyesight to see what they want to create, and then use their imagination to make it real. Audiogenic creativity is when an artist creates a piece of art by using sound instead of sight.

The impact of invention on society: from novelties to products that saved lives or made a difference
Invention has exploded in recent years as new and innovative technologies have led to products that have made a difference in society. Some of these products have saved lives, such as the iPhone and the Nike sneaker, while others have made a small impact, such as the solar cooker or the artificial intelligence development. However, no product has had a lasting impact on society like the invention of the printing press. The printing press allowed for books to be printed one letter at a time which led to increased communication and helped create an understanding of complex topics across cultures.

What is innovation?
Innovation is the process of creating new products, services or ideas that differ from those currently in use. Innovation can be seen as a way to improve the quality of life for users, as well as innovation can help companies grow and succeed. There are many different types of innovation, but some common ones include:
1. New technology: This includes any new method or invention that improves on what has been used before. For example, a recent innovation is using drones to deliver food items to customers. This type of innovation has the potential to change how we consume and provide better service at a much lower cost than traditional methods.

2. Beating the competition: This refers to improving upon an existing product or service in order to bring about a competitive advantage over your opponents. For example, Apple Inc.

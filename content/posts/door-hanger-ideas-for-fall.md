Differential Pricing: What is differential pricing and how can it be used in your business?
Differential pricing is a marketing strategy that divides the market into two or more segments and pricing their products differently to encourage sales within each segment. This allows businesses to sell their products at a lower wholesale price and then sell them at a higher price to buyers in other segments. It can also be used for product differentiation, driving sales by making one product more affordable than another.

The difference between creative and non-creative art: What makes one more creative than the other?
Creative art is often seen as something that is more "creative" than non-creative. This may be based on the individual's creative skills or simply their preferences. There are a few key elements to creative art, which can make it more creative than non-creative: 1) The artist has a passion for their work and feels an intense connection to it. This can be seen in the artist's eyes when they're creating, and it shows in their work as a whole. 2) The artist uses their creativity to explore new ideas, or come up with new ways of existing within the world. Non-creative artists may only focus on what they know, and may not explore any new ideas or different perspectives.

How can you create a compelling value proposition?
Creating a compelling value proposition is a critical part of any business. By understanding and addressing the needs of your target audience, you can create a product or service that offers value to customers. Here are four pieces of advice to help you create a solid value proposition:
1)Clarify what your product or service does that others don't. Define what your customers need and want, and make sure your offer encompasses this. If they don't know what it is, they're likely not going to want it.
2)Know who your target market is. A good way to identify this is by doing market research on yourself or your competition. Understand the unique needs of your target market and craft your value proposition around these goals.
3)Make sure the price is fair.

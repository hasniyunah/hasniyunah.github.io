Different types of innovation: What are some common examples?
Innovation is a term that has been used for centuries to describe different types of change. Different types of innovation can be described in two ways: product and process innovation. Product innovation refers to the development of a new product, while process innovation refers to the improvement of a process, such as adding new technology or modifying an existing one. 
Product innovation usually occurs when two companies come up with a new product that is better than what was before. Process innovation, on the other hand, often happens when companies try to improve an existing process so it can be more efficient and accurate. This can involve adding new technology or changing how an old process is run.

The Relationship of Invention to Technology: What makes an invention useful?
Invention is the process of creating a new product or service from scratch. However, Invention can also bedefined as the creation of a new way of doing something, whether it’s in the realm of technology or business. Inventions have revolutionized how we live, work and interact with the world around us. They have also allowed for advancements in technology that we could never have thought possible. 
However, there are a few things to keep in mind when it comes to Invention. First, Invention has to be useful- if it’s not, it won’t be adopted by society as quickly as some inventions have. Second, Invention has to be affordable- if it’s too expensive or difficult to create a working prototype, people will not adopt it.

Defining Innovation
Innovation is a term that is used frequently but often left undefined. This creates confusion when discussing innovation and can lead to misunderstanding its true meaning. When speaking about innovation, one must first define it in order to have a common understanding of the topic at hand.
Innovation is typically defined as introducing something new, whether it be an idea, method, or product. However, this definition does not capture the full scope of what innovation entails. Innovation often leads to change, which can be either incremental or radical. Incremental change is small and gradual, while radical change is more significant and happens suddenly. Both types of changes are essential for innovation to occur.

There are many factors that contribute to innovation. One important factor is a company’s culture.

Contemporary Inventions: The computer, the internet, 3D printing
Invention is the key to progress. It is what takes us from the horse and buggy to the automobile, from telegraphs to telephones, from mainframe computers to laptops. And it is what has given us 3D printing, a technology that has the potential to change manufacturing as we know it.
3D printing is an additive manufacturing process, which means that it builds objects by adding layers of material one at a time. This is in contrast to subtractive manufacturing processes like CNC machining, which involve cutting away material to create an object.

3D printing has been around for decades, but it has only recently become accessible to consumers and small businesses. Thanks to advances in 3D printer technology and the availability of affordable 3D printers, this transformative technology is now within reach of anyone with an idea and a bit of creativity.

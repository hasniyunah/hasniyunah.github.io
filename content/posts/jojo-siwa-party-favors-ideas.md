Big ideas are those that could have a significant impact on the world. They can be things that people have never thought of, or ideas that are relatively new and unexplored. Sometimes these big ideas are developed by teams of people working together, and sometimes they are created by someone who is just thinking out loud. Regardless of who came up with the idea, it is important to diffuse it and see if anyone else can come up with a better option.

Why are big ideas so important?
Big ideas are the foundation of any great idea, and they can be a driving force behind your innovation. Here are five reasons why big ideas are so important:
1. They build on those that have been done before. A big idea is always new and original, making it easier to come up with new and innovative ideas. This makes it harder for others to copy, which in turn allows you to rest assured that your product or service will be successful.

2. They can help you focus on the right things. When you have a large number of big ideas circling around your head, it can be difficult to know where to start and what to focus on. By having a few big ideas at the forefront of your mind, you can more easily stay focused on what‚Äôs important and get the job done rather than trying too many things at once.

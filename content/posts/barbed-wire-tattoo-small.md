Conclusion: Why should someone invented a product or service?
Invention Ideas: Why Should Someone Imported a Product or Service?
There are many reasons why someone might want to import a product or service. Maybe the company is new and exciting, or maybe there is something about the product or service that someone wants. Whatever the reason, one must ask: What are the benefits of importing a product or service? 
Some potential benefits of importing a product or service include: lower costs, improved quality, greater selection, and faster delivery. Additionally, imported products can be more user-friendly than domestic products. For example, if someone is familiar with a domestic product but they are not familiar with an imported product, they may be more likely to try out the imported product before choosing the home-grown option. 
It's important to remember that not every benefit of importing a product or service will be beneficial.

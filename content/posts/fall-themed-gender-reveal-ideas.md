The challenges of big ideas: What can prevent them from becoming successful?
When it comes to big ideas, sometimes the obstacles are simply too great. When it comes to innovation, often times what's required is a willingness to take on new challenges and risk everything for the sake of something better. But in some cases, taking such risks can actually backfire, leading to less innovation and more stagnation. Here are six examples of how big ideas can fail:
1) Failing to appreciate the uniqueness of each idea

One of the biggest challenges faced by big ideas is that they often come from unique perspectives or points of view. This can be difficult to take on and even harder to understand, let alone replicate. In order for an idea to succeed, it needs to be seen as unique and valuable in its own right – not just by those who came up with it but also by those who will use it in the future.

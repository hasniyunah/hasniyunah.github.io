brain washing: How can people be made to do things they don't want to do?
How can people be made to do things they don't want to do? There are many ways, but some of the most common methods are brainwashing and suggestion. Brainwashing is a process of inducing someone to change their views or behavior by using persuasive techniques. suggesting someone does something based on their eagerness or attraction often works better than actual coercion. Brainwashing techniques typically range from subtle (like reinforcing positive thoughts) to blatant (such as convincing someone that they have no choice in the matter). 
There are a few different types of brainwashing, but the most common is suggestion. Suggestion is when you say something that might make someone do something they wouldn't normally do. For example, if you tell a person they have to go outside for 5 minutes, that might suggest to them that it's time for them to get up and leave.

Goals: What are our goals for 2022?
The 2022 FIFA World Cup is coming up and there are a few things that everyone is focusing on. One of the things that seems to be getting a lot of attention is the goalkeepersâ€™ competition. Many people are wondering what our goals for the tournament are, and whether or not they will be met. Here are some ideas for what our goals may be: 
1) We want to win the trophy. This has been a main goal of ours for quite some time now, and we believe that we can do it if we focus hard and take our game to new levels. 

2) We want to make sure that our players are given everything they need to be successful. We understand that some players may have had their best years already past them, so we want to help them recapture those formative years and continue making progress forward.

The 4 Cs of Creative Work: What are some factors to consider when coming up with ideas?
Creative work is all about coming up with new and innovative ideas. Sometimes, the best way to do this is through brainstorming sessions or informal discussions with friends or colleagues. But what are some factors to consider when coming up with creative ideas? Here are four key ones:
1. Category: What is your idea in question? This will determine its feasibility and whether it can be turned into a successful product or service.
2. Concept: How well does your idea align with the category you have chosen? If it's a new take on an old product, for example, then you'll need to come up with a concept that makes sense within the category being explored. And if your idea isn't aligned in any way, it might not be worth pursuing at all.
3. Target Market: Who can actually use your idea?

Differential Pricing: What is differential pricing and how can it be used in your business?
Differential pricing is a marketing strategy that divides the market into two or more segments and pricing their products differently to encourage sales within each segment. This allows businesses to sell their products at a lower wholesale price and then sell them at a higher price to buyers in other segments. It can also be used for product differentiation, driving sales by making one product more affordable than another.

Futures of technology
What do you think the future holds for technology? Some believe that it will continue to evolve and grow, while others predict that it will become more advanced and complex. Either way, there are a number of ideas that could be explored in order to further advance this field. Here are some possible scenarios:
1) In 2022, we may see advances in 3D printing technology that allow for objects to be created from multiple layers of plastic or other materials. This would allow for a significant increase in the number of products that can be manufactured on a large scale, as well as faster and easier production times.

2) Another development that could impact our industry is the advent of artificial intelligence (AI). As machines get better at learning and responding to various challenges, they may become capable of performing tasks that were once considered impossible or too difficult for humans to perform.

Marketing: How to market your invention idea
Assuming you have an invention idea and want to market it, there are a few key things to keep in mind. First, it's important to do your research and understand both the industry and your potential customers. Who is your target market? What needs does your product address? How does your product compare to other similar products on the market? Once you have a solid understanding of these things, you can begin developing a marketing strategy.
There are a number of ways to go about marketing your invention idea. One option is to sell directly to companies who may be interested in manufacturing or distributing your product. Another option is to work with an invention marketing firm who can help you patent and protect your idea and then market it to potential buyers. Whichever route you choose, be sure to put together a strong pitch that highlights the need for your product and how it benefits consumers.

The Creative Process: How does one go about coming up with creative ideas?
Creative ideas can come from anywhere, but the creative process typically starts with an idea. This idea is typically something that has been on someone’s mind for a while, but they have never had a good way to bring it to fruition. The creative process starts by sorting through all of the options and trying to find the best one for the project at hand. Next, the team needs to come up with a rough plan for how they will execute the idea. Once everything is set in stone, it’s time for creativity to take over!

Introduce the topic of creative ideas.
Creative ideas are the core of what drives businesses and industries. They are what inspire people to come up with new products, services, and ways of doing things. Many businesses have creative departments or teams whose sole purpose is to generate new ideas.
There are a number of ways to generate new ideas. One is brainstorming, which is when a group of people get together and try to come up with as many ideas as possible, without judging or critiquing them. Another way is to look at what other businesses are doing and see if there’s something you can improve upon or do differently.

You can also try asking customers or clients what they would like to see from your business. Sometimes the best ideas come from the people who are actually using your products or services. And don’t forget about your employees!

How does creativity work? How do artists create their unique works of art? What is the difference between creative and non-creative art?
Creativity is a complex and mysterious process that scientists still do not understand. Some artists say that creativity comes from the need to find a new way to approach an old problem. Creative people are often risk takers, and they often use their imagination to come up with ideas that might not have been thought of before. There are two types of creativity- creative art and non-creative art. Creative art is usually more time-consuming, but it can be rewarding because it can lead to new insights or ideas about the world. Non-creative art is less time-consuming, but it may not lead to new insights or ideas about the world.

How to develop them: Be creative
Invention ideas don't just come to people in a sudden eureka moment; usually, it's the result of a process of development. If you want to learn how to develop your own invention ideas, there are a few things you can do. 
First, take some time to brainstorm and think about the problems you encounter in your daily life. What would make your life easier? What does not work well or efficiently? Once you have identified some potential areas for improvement, do some research to see if anyone else has had the same idea. 

Next, start thinking about possible solutions to the problem. How could it be fixed? What would be the best way to achieve this? Try to come up with several different ideas, and then evaluate each one. Which one is most feasible? Which one would be the most effective?

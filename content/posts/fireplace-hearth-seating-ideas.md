The history of creative art: How did creativity dawn and what has been its most successful application?
Creativity has been around since ancient times and is one of the most popular applications of creativity in today’s world. One of its earliest incarnations was art, which began to be developed as a way to communicate with others. Art was used to depict beautiful things and express feelings, which is why it has been such an important part of human culture. From there, creative art started to be used in more practical ways, such as for making things that people could use or sell. It even went on to be adopted by businesses and other institutions, helping them produce more efficient products. With so many different applications for creativity, it is hard to say which one has been the most successful in terms of revenue and impact.

Types of creativity: Intuitive, logical, creative, and gestural
Creativity is a highly subjective term that can be defined in many ways. Some might say that creativity is the ability to come up with new ideas, while others might say that creativity is simply making something new. Whatever definition one chooses, there are some key elements to creative thinking which are all based on intuition. Intuitive thinking often comes from the subconscious and is not based on logical thought processes. This makes it much more difficult to control, but can also be very effective in solving problems or creating solutions.

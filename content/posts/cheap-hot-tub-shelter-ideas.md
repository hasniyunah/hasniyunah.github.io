How To Come Up With Ideas: What are some creative ways to come up with ideas?
Creative ideas come in all shapes and sizes, but they all have one common goal: to help something else become a reality. Whether it’s coming up with a new product idea or coming up with a plan to improve something you’re working on, creativity is essential to any successful project. Here are four tips for coming up with creative ideas: 1. Take your time – Don’t try to come up with an idea right away. In most cases, it won’t be the best option, and you may not get very far without some effort. 2. Be open to new ideas – There are always going to be new ways of thinking when it comes to ideas, so don’t be afraid to experiment.

What is invention?
Invention is the process of creating a new product or service from scratch. It can be a simple idea, such as coming up with a new way to make soap, or more complex ideas, such as designing a new car. Inventions can have different origins and take different forms, but they all share one common goal: making life easier for others.

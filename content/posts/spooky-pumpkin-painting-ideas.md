What can we do to prepare for 2020?
It has been announced that the United States will be leaving the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2020. This decision is a result of the US president, Donald Trump, wanting to reduce trade deficits and increase economic growth. The main challenge for many countries planning for 2020 is how to prepare for this event. Here are some ideas to help: 
1. Make sure you have an idea of what your country’s trade deficit is. This information can be found on various websites or by talking to your business or government officials. 
2. Get involved in tariff debates with other countries. This can help you develop agreements that will protect your industry from new tariffs being placed by other countries. 
3. Do research on future trends in trade. By doing this, you will be able to identify any potential problems that may arise during the 2020 WTO membership negotiations.

Conclusion: the importance of creative art in our lives
It is safe to say that creative art is important in our lives. After all, it is one of the few things that can truly make us feel alive. It can inspire us, move us, and even change us.
Think about the last time you were moved by a piece of art. Maybe it was a painting, a song, or even a film. Whatever it was, it likely had a profound effect on you. That’s because creative art has the power to touch our souls in a way that nothing else can.

It’s also important to remember that creative art is not just about entertainment. It can also be used as a powerful tool for self-expression and healing.

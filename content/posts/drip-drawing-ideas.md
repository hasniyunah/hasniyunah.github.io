Exploring the unconscious mind in creative people: How does the subconscious contribute to creativity?
Creative people often have a higher level of awareness and are better equipped to see connections between ideas and the world around them. This can lead to new and more thought-provoking ways of looking at things, which in turn allows them to be more creative. However, it's not just the conscious mind that is responsible for creativity - the unconscious mind also plays a part. The unconscious mind is made up of hidden thoughts, feelings, and memories that we don't usually consider. It's where our creative potential lies - it's where we store all our ideas, inspiration, and dreams. Exploring the unconscious mind in creative people can help them become more aware of their own power and potential to be creative. By understanding how the subconscious helps us to be more creative, they can use their creativity to achieve their goals.

Creative artists: How many there are and what makes them special?
Creative artists are an often overlooked but important part of the art world. They come from many different backgrounds and have a range of different skills and techniques. Some are able to use their creative abilities to create beautiful or powerful artwork, while others specialize in specific genres or styles. However, all artists have something special that sets them apart from other artists. Here are four examples: 
Allison Bechdel is a well-known cartoonist who specializes in creation of humorous strips about female characters, which has made her one of the most recognizable and popular comic book authors of all time; performance artist Grant Wood created memorable posters and paintings during the Depression era that stand as benchmarks for American artistry; and David Stone Martin is known for his dramatic story-telling with his unique use of sound and light.

How to get started with creative ideas: What should you do first?
Creative ideas are a key part of any business or creative project. However, getting started can be difficult. Here are four tips to help you get started:
1. Look at your goals 
First, ask yourself what kind of creativity you want to achieve. Do you want to create new ideas, or simply improve on old ones? If your answer is "both," look for ways to combine your two skills. Are you interested in creating products, services, or designs? Then look into Lynda.com and online resources such as Illustrator and Photoshop for help.
2. Get organized 
Once you have a basic idea of what you want to accomplish, it's time to start thinking about how to achieve it. Try creating a timeline/schedule for your project and working with someone else who can help guide you along the way.

How can we develop big ideas?
When it comes to big ideas, anyone can have them. It's just a matter of coming up with a plan and executing it. Here are four tips that can help you get started:
1. Definition: What is your idea?

 defines your idea in the most concise way possible, which will give you more room to work on it without feeling overwhelmed. Once you've nailed down what your idea is, make sure that everyone who will need to hear it (including yourself) agrees on its importance. This will ensure that the idea has enough power to carry out its potential.

2. Execution: How are you going to execute your idea?

This is where things get tricky. If your plan isn't well- thought-out or if you don't have enough manpower or resources at your disposal, your idea won't be able to take off.

Invention is the process of coming up with a new idea or product that wasn't already in existence. Invention often takes place in the form of a new idea, design, or technology. It can also come from scratch, during the development of a new product. Many inventions are made for commercial reasons, such as making a new product that is more affordable or easier to use.

The Future of Work: What will defining trends look like in the future?
In the near future, work will become more dispersed and flexible. This new trend will lead to a lack of employee-led organizations and a rise in the number of independent contractors. As a result, companies will have to find other ways to provide benefits and employees with regular paychecks. In addition, technology will play an important role in this shift as it will allow for more flexibility in work hours and tasks.

Creative process: How do you go about creative art?
Creative art is a process that involves the use of creativity and originality in order to create something new. There are many different ways to go about creative art, but the most common approach is through inspiration. Inspiration can come from anything – from looked at photos to watching someone else work. Sometimes inspiration can be hard to come by, so it’s important to be prepared for it when it does arrive. Once you have some ideas for what you want your creative piece to look like, the next step is to start thinking about how you will go about putting those ideas into reality. There are many different ways to go about this, and it all depends on what type of creative art you want to create. If you want a piece that is Spicer-like or if you just want something that is unique, there are many different ways that you can go about it.

Why do we have them?: how do they originate?
Most of us have had ideas. Some of us have had great ideas, others less so. But where do these ideas come from? How do they originate?
Ideas can come from anywhere and everywhere. They can come from our own minds, or from the minds of other people. They can come from books, movies, or even just casual conversations.

Ideas can also originate from our experiences. We might have a new idea after experiencing something for the first time, or after seeing someone else experience it. Or we might have an idea that comes to us in a dream.

There is no one answer to where ideas come from. They can come from anywhere and anyone. The important thing is what we do with them once we have them.

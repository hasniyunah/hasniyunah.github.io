The role of creativity in art: What are some benefits to using creativity in artwork?
Creativity is an important factor in art. For example, when artists create pieces that are unique and share a certain style, they are able to stand out from other artists.

For example, if an artist is trying to come up with new ideas for a painting, they may be more creative when creating the design than if they were just following someone else’s idea. Lastly, creativity can also be used in order to make an artwork look more professional or attractive.

Innovation is a key topic in business. A product, process, market, and technology that are innovative can help a company achieve success. There are many types of innovation, and each one has its own strengths and weaknesses. Here are three examples: 
Product Innovation: A product that is new and different can help a company succeed. For example, Nike's "Champion" sneakers were revolutionary because they were the first shoes to use air pressure to keep the foot elevated during exercise.

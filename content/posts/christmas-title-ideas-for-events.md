Guidelines for creativity
Creativity is a Keyword for Today's World
There are many ways to be creative and some people believe that creativity is only found in the arts. Others believe that creativity can be found in any activity that leads to new ideas or solutions. The guidelines for being creative are as follows:

1. Be open to new ideas. This means that you should not be afraid to experiment with what you do, even if it does not seem fun or interesting at first. It can result in some great ideas that can help make your work more successful.

2. Allow yourself time and space to brainstorm. It takes time and effort to come up with new ideas, so don't try to do too much at once. Give yourself enough time so that you can come up with several good ones before having to choose one.

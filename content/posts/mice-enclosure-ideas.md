The Benefits of Innovation: Why are innovations successful? What are some common benefits?
Innovation is a process of exploring, testing and improving upon ideas. It has the potential to improve entire industries while making people's lives more comfortable and efficient. There are many benefits to innovation, including increased productivity, reduced costs, diverse product offerings and improved customer service.
There are several reasons why innovations are successful, but some of the most common are: 1) novelty – when something is different from what is already available, people tend to be interested in it; 2) risk-taking – when something is new and challenging, it can inspire people to take chances; 3) collaboration – when people are working together towards a common goal, they're more likely to come up with innovative solutions; 4) execution – ensuring that the innovation is implemented effectively can help increase its success rate.

How to do brainstroming effectively
Picture a room full of people, all focused on one task. They are all working together towards a common goal. This is the brainstroming effect, or the power of team work.
The brainstroming effect works because people's brains are tuned to multi-tasking. When we're focusing on one task, our attention span is limited and it takes longer for our brain to process information. This can lead to confusion and a lack of focus.

However, if we switch our focus away from the task at hand, our brains are more likely to revert back to their normal processing speed and be more productive once again. In fact, science has found that when we switch our focus away from a task for just a few seconds, the speed of our brainstems activity decreases by 50%.

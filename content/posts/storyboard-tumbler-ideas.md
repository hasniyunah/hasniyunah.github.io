Types of creativity: The five levels of creativity.
Creativity is a broad term that refers to a range of different activities and thoughts that can lead to new ideas or products. While creativity can be thought of in different ways, five levels are generally agreed upon: 1) Inspiration: Seeing something beautiful or unique and wanting to create something similar or inspired by it. 
2) Intuition: Knowing what you want and being able to think outside the box to come up with creative solutions. 
3) Expression: Putting your creative ideas into action and seeing how they turn out. 
4) Arousal: Feeling good about your work or the final product after completing it.

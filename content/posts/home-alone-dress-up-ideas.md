What are the challenges of having big ideas?
There are a few key challenges that come with having big ideas, according to Jason Fried. Fried is the author of The Lean Startup, a book on how to build successful startups. In his book, he discusses how it can be tough to stay creative and keep up with new ideas when your mind is constantly filled with too many thoughts. 
One challenge is that it can be hard to remember what you just thought of. Another is that it can be difficult to get your thoughts down in writing form. Finally, Fried says that it can be hard to see the big picture when you're thinking about individual products or services.

Creativity is a natural and essential part of many people s lives. It can be used to create new ideas, or to explore old ones. But what happens to creativity once it s completed?
There are a few factors that can affect the quality of creativity after it s complete. The first is whether or not the creative person has received enough feedback. If they haven t, they may not have been able to improve their ideas or come up with new ways to approach problems. The second factor is the intensity of the creative process itself. If it s gentle, nurturing, and doesn t require any hard work or effort on the part of the creator, then they may be more likely to maintain their creative Passions for life. But if the creative process is strenuous and demanding, then they may not be as inspired again as soon as they once were.

4) Transform transportation infrastructure
Transportation infrastructure is important for both people and businesses. It includes roads, bridges, airports, and other areas that allow people to move around and businesses to run their operations. But as the world moves increasingly towards electric vehicles and other forms of transportation that don't use gasoline or oil, the need for transportation infrastructure will only become more important. 
One way to improve the transportation infrastructure is to create more efficient ways to generate energy. Another way to improve it is to consider how people can be better connected with one another while they are on their way to or from work or school. 

There are a number of ideas that could be put into place in order to improve transportation infrastructure.

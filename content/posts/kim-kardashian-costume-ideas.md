The Pros and Cons: How do these new ideas compare and contrast with what is already known?
There are a lot of new ideas out there. Do you know what they all are? Let's take a look.

Another difference between the new ideas and what has been done before is that some of the old solutions may not be as effective anymore or may not work as well anymore in the modern world.

How can we create innovation in our organizations?
There are many ways to create innovation in organizations. One way is to find outside sources of inspiration and learn from them. Another way is to come up with your own ideas and see how they can be implemented. Finally, it is important to constantly resist the urge to simply copy others and instead be creative and innovative yourself. These three methods can help a organization create innovation while maintaining its traditions and culture.

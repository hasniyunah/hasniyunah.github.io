The definition of creativity has changed over time, but the essentials remain the same: creativity involves using your own mind and imagination to come up with new ideas or solutions.

Innovation is a process of thought, creativity and change that occurs in any company. It can be found in everything from the smallest idea to the biggest product.

Additionally, it’s essential to have a clear vision for the future and how your product or service will help make that vision a reality. Lastly, it’s essential to keep all of these things in mind when developing your product or service – otherwise you may find yourself at risk of becoming stagnant in your industry or at risk of becoming irrelevant.

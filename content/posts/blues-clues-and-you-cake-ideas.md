2. Choose the right style for your article. There are many different ways to write an article, and there is no one style that is best for all situations. You can use a simple, straight-forward layout or you can go for something more experimental and stylish.

3. Use formatting features wisely. When writing articles, always use grammar and punctuation correctly. This will help readers understand your piece and stay on target throughout the entire process.

4. Avoid using clichés and other easy-to-spot errors.

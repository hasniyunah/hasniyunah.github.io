Take flight!: Are there any other ways you can use your creativity to help solve problems?
Creativity can be used in a number of ways to solve problems. One way is to come up with big ideas.

2) brainstorming – This process helps you come up with multiple solutions at the same time and then put them all together to see which one might work best.

The history and definition of creative art: Creative art can be defined as any art which is created with the intention to communicate a message or create a piece that has a unique aesthetic.
Creative art has been around for centuries, and has gradually evolved over time. Initially, creative art was only used for religious or spiritual purposes, but as time passed it became increasingly common to see creative art used in everyday life. Today, creative art is widely accepted and enjoyed by all. There are many different types of creative art, and each has its own unique abilities and benefits.
One of the most important factors in determining whether or not creativity is present in any given piece of creative art is the artist’s intention. If an artist is simply trying to communicate a message or create an experience that is enjoyable, then their work will likely be considered creative. However, if the artist is trying to create something that is new and exciting, then their work will likely fall into the category of creative art.

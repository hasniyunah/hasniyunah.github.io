What are big ideas?
When it comes to big ideas, there are many dimensions to consider. These can be broken down into four categories: problem, solution, opportunity and impact. 
Problem: How can we make our world a better place? 
Solution: There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question; each person's perspective and situation will dictate the best way to solve a problem. However, there are a few general concepts that can be used in order to determine what type of solution may work best for a given situation. One such concept is called the "Golden Rule." This states that you should do what is right, even if it doesn't make sense at first. 

Opportunity: What are the possible consequences of our actions? 

Impact: What kind of change or impact will our solutions have?

Conclusion: What are some big ideas to consider for your blog or website?
When it comes to content, a blog or website is all about creating an audience. Whether you’re looking to generate new readers or keep an audience engaged with your current content, there are a few big ideas you can consider for your site. 
The first big idea is to focus on topic exclusivity. This means that you only focused on one aspect of your subject matter and made sure that it was the most important aspect of your blog or website. By doing this, you’ve narrowed down the topics that your readers will be interested in and will be more likely to stick around for as long as possible. 

Another big idea is to make sure that your blog or website is easy to navigate. This means making sure that every page has a clear title, header, and menu system so that readers can quickly find what they’re looking for.

Definition of innovation: How does it differ from other concepts?
Innovation is the process of creating something new and different from what has been done before. It can be defined in many ways, but one common definition is that innovation is the creation of a new product, service, or idea that is better than what was available before. Innovation can be found in everything from fashion to technology to business.
If you think about it, innovation is pretty much just a way to make things better. After all, if there was nothing new or different out there to work with, how would anyone ever come up with a new idea? In fact, innovation often comes from coming up with an idea that nobody else has thought of before. So while it may seem like a pretty big responsibility, it's actually quite easy to get started on when you have some basic ideas about what you're looking for.

Creative abilities: What are they and how do they differ from other abilities?
Creative abilities can be defined in many different ways, but the most commonly accepted definition is that creativity is a quality or state of being that enables people to come up with new and innovative ideas. This ability can differ from person to person, but typically it refers to a spark of inspiration or an idea that comes to mind.
There are several different ways creative abilities can be measured, including creative thinking tests and creative writing exercises. However, the most common way to measure creativity is through art or poetry. This is because art has the ability to stir emotions and evoke feelings in people, which can then be used as a measure of creativity.

There are also several other abilities that may contribute to creativity, such as problem-solving skills, listening skills, and communication skills. However, these Abilities do not typically go hand in hand with creativity.

Types of creative art: What are they?
Creative art includes a wide variety of styles and genres, but each has its own unique elements. Styles can be described by their shapes and how they are used to communicate ideas or emotions. Genres can be categorized by the stories they tell, the messages they impart, or the objects or people that are used in them. Ultimately, creative art is a way to express yourself and connect with others.

Defining big ideas
There are a lot of big ideas out there. But what exactly are they? And how can we define them?
A big idea is an overarching concept or theme that is central to a work of art, literature, or philosophy. It is usually something that the author wants to communicate to the audience, and it can be interpreted in many ways.

One way to think of a big idea is as a symbol or motif that represents something larger than itself. For example, in the novel The Great Gatsby, the green light on Daisy Buchanan’s dock represents hope and possibility. In Shakespeare’s play Romeo and Juliet, the balcony scene is a symbol of young love and its potential for tragedy.

Another way to define a big idea is as an abstract concept that can be explored in different ways.

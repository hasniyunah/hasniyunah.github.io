Creative art in the contemporary world: What challenges does creativity face in the 21st century?
Creativity is facing new challenges in the 21st century. One of the most important aspects of creativity is the ability to process information. Many modern day technologies have made it easier for people to get information and create artistry without having to leave their homes. However, this has also created some challenges for creatives. For example, many people no longer need to go outside to experience nature. They can now access creative content online or on screens all around them. This has created a problem for creatives, as they are no longer able to experience the natural environment around them. The other challenge creatives face is that technology has not always been accurate when it comes to depicting real life events and scenes. For example, many people believe that Trump was elected president because he had an "impenetrable" wall with Mexico. However, this is not accurate at all.

Future of Technology: What will the next big thing be?
As technology advances, there are always new and exciting possibilities for it to be used in different ways. One of the most likely examples of this is the use of artificial intelligence (AI). AI has already been used in many different ways, such as helping people with their day-to-day tasks, but it is only in the future that it will be used to create truly intelligent machines. This would mean that we could see machines that can think and process vast amounts of data on their own, making them stronger and smarter than ever before. Some believe that AI will even lead to a future where we don't need humans at all – we could have automated civilizations running our lives on autopilot. If this happens, we would have to rethink a lot of things about what it means to live in a world where technology is the protagonist.

Conclusion: What is creativity and what can it do for us?
Creativity is the ability to come up with new ideas, concepts, or solutions to problems. It can be used for good or bad. The good side of creativity is that it can help us come up with new ideas, solutions, and ways to improve our lives. The bad side of creativity is that it can cause us to be creative and think outside the box, but also can lead us astray from the paths we were meant to take. Despite these risks, creativity is something that should be cherished and appreciated.

creativity: How do you improve your invention ideas?
Creativity is essential to any invention. Every step of the process from Ideation to Execution should be tailored to increase creativity and improve the chances of a successful product. Here are four tips for improving your invention ideas:
1. Be persistent

This way, you won’t get lost in your work and can focus on what really matters- developing a great product.

2. Be open to feedback
Feedback is key in ANY creative process.

Definition of innovation: How does it differ from previous generations?
Innovation is the process of coming up with a new idea or product that is different from what has been done before. It can be classified into two main categories, incremental and revolutionary. Incremental innovation occurs in areas such as technology, business, and marketing; while revolutionary innovation occurs in areas such as science, medicine, and the environment. 
The definition of innovation has changing over time, but two main aspects have remained consistent: it should be creative, and it should be new to the market. Innovations should also be feasible to implement quickly and cost-effective. In order to achieve these goals, companies must have a clear understanding of how innovation works and how to define it narrowly or expansively according to their needs.

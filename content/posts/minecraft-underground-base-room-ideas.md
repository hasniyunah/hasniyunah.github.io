Differential Pricing: What is differential pricing and how can it be used in your business?
Differential pricing is a marketing strategy that divides the market into two or more segments and pricing their products differently to encourage sales within each segment. This allows businesses to sell their products at a lower wholesale price and then sell them at a higher price to buyers in other segments. It can also be used for product differentiation, driving sales by making one product more affordable than another.

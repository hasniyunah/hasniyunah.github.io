How Invention began
Invention is a process of creating something new and often involving the use of an unknown or unusual tool. Many inventions have originated from the simplest concepts, such as a design for a shirt that was first conceived by a tailor. Other inventions, like the transistor, were created through years of trial and error before they were finally realized in devices such as radios and TVs. Inventions can be so important to our society that they are often consideredtreasures, and some have even been donated to universities or used in scientific research.

Negative aspects of innovation: What are some potential dangers
When it comes to innovation, there are a few potential dangers that often come with it. Some of these potential dangers could have a negative effect on businesses, consumers and even the innovation industry itself. Here are four examples:
1. Lacking enough sober consideration can lead to reckless Innovation.
2. False assumptions can be created automatically and without much thought, leading to more risky and potentially harmful innovations.
3. Unsafe and impractical products may be born from passionate experimentation and creative thinking, but they could also lead to serious problems down the road if not Icarus-ed away right away. 
4. New ideas can sometimes become what we call " dragons ." These creatures are often able to take over our brains and control our destiny – but only if we let them.

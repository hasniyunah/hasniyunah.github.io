How to do brainstroming effectively
Picture a room full of people, all focused on one task. They are all working together towards a common goal. This is the brainstroming effect, or the power of team work.
The brainstroming effect works because people's brains are tuned to multi-tasking. When we're focusing on one task, our attention span is limited and it takes longer for our brain to process information. This can lead to confusion and a lack of focus.

However, if we switch our focus away from the task at hand, our brains are more likely to revert back to their normal processing speed and be more productive once again. In fact, science has found that when we switch our focus away from a task for just a few seconds, the speed of our brainstems activity decreases by 50%.

7 Tips for the Purpose of Creativity: What are some tips for using creativity effectively in your work?
1. Make a list of ideas. This can be done in any format, but a list of ideas will help you to get started.
2. Think about how you can use the ideas on your list. If you cannot come up with an idea on your own, think about what others have done and what they used to achieve their goals.
3. Draw inspiration from other people and things around you. Studies have shown that imitation is one of the best ways to learn something new. Look at things around you and see how they have helped someone else achieve their goals or reached their dreams.
4: Take action! No matter what creativity may seem like, taking action is always the best way to go towards achieving your goals! Start by thinking of ways that you can improve or take actions that will help your creativity become successful.

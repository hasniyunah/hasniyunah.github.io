The three types of creativity: originality, imagination, and inventions
Creativity is a difficult quality to definition, as there are many different ways to define creativity. One example is imagining something or creating something new. Another example is originality, which refers to the invention or creation of something new. 
There are three main types of creativity: imaginative, creative, and invented. Imagination is the ability to see an idea or concept in your mind and create it out of nothing. Creative creativity comes from using your imagination and coming up with ideas that you haven’t thought of before. Inventions are creations that have never been done before and usually require a lot of hard work and dedication to make them a reality.

Conclusion: Summarize the main points of the article.
A new invention is always something to be celebrated. It's a sign that progress is being made and that people are still coming up with new and innovative ideas. But what happens when an invention goes wrong? When it doesn't work as intended or, even worse, causes harm?
There have been plenty of examples throughout history of inventions that have had disastrous consequences. The atomic bomb is perhaps the most famous example. Invented during World War II, it was used twice in combat, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people.

Other examples include the Ford Pinto, which was prone to exploding if involved in a rear-end collision, and the Segway, which has been involved in numerous accidents and injuries.

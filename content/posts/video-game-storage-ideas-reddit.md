Development: How do you stretch an idea into a reality?
Invention is a process of coming up with a new idea that either solves an existing problem or makes a new one. This can be done in many ways, but the most common way to come up with an invention is through brainstorming. By doing this, you will get ideas for products, services, or even ideas for how to improve your business.
There are a few things you need to do in order to make an invention a reality. The first is to come up with an idea that has potential commercial value. Second, make sure that the idea is unique and can’t be found on the market already. Third, find partners who are interested in developing and marketing the product or service. Finally, make sure that the product or service is easy and affordable to market and sell.

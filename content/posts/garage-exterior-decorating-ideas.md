What are some new ideas?
There are a lot of new ideas out there these days. Here are some of the most popular: 
1) Introduction to computer programming – This is a new course that has been moderately successful in increasing interest in computer science. It covers everything from basic coding to more complex topics, making it an excellent introduction to the field for those who want to start homebrewing or develop their own software projects. 
2) A way for people with mental health conditions to interact with the world – This is a trend that is growing slowly but surely, as more and more people realize just how important it is for people with mental health conditions to have access to support and information (and not just be left on their own). Some companies are starting to create websites and apps specifically for people with mental health conditions, so this trend is only going to continue growing.

Types of innovation: How they work
Innovation is the process of creating new products or services that are different from those that have been previously created.

In order to create innovative products or services, companies must first come up with a new idea, and then develop and test it so that it works. There are a number of different types of innovation, each with its own advantages and disadvantages.

They then work on developing the product until it is ready to sell. Product development can be time-consuming, but can also lead to high profits if the product is successful.

Definition of innovation: The process of coming up with a new, original idea or product.
Innovation is the process of coming up with a new, original idea or product. Innovation can come in many forms, but it's most commonly used when someone comes up with a new way to do something. Innovation can be seen as the result of ideas and exploration, as well as the courage to take risks. For example, Apple was able to come up with the iPhone thanks to their innovation. In order for innovation to work, there must be a clear vision and an understanding of what people want and need. This requires creativity and risk-taking, both of which are something that often isn't easy to find in most businesses.

What is invention?
Invention is an act or process of coming up with a new solution to a problem. Invention has come from many different places, including science, business and creativity. Today, invention is used more often in technology than it ever has been before. 
Invention can be something as simple as making a new product or service or taking an idea and turning it into a reality. Sometimes invention comes from the simplest things- like coming up with a better way to chop wood. Other times, it takes longer but is more complex- like coming up with a new way to print money or create new ways to store information. 

But whatever the case, when someone comes up with an innovative solution, that’s something special. It shows they have think outside the box and are willing to try somethingnew just to see if it works.

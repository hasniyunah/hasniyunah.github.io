History of innovation:
Innovation has been a part of human history for as long as humans have been able to think about it. From the early civilizations that developed methods of making things that didn't exist before, to the modern day innovators who are constantly creating new ways to improve life and make it more efficient, innovation is something that has always been a part of our lives. And yet, there was once a time where innovation was practically nonexistent in most cultures. This was the era known as the Dark Ages.

While some aspects of this time period did experience some form of innovation, such as new methods of farming or weapons, most aspects of society were either unaltered or slowly improving upon what existed before.

Think about the last time you came up with an idea. How did it feel? Did everything click into place and do what you wanted? If not, why not?

What are creative ideas?
Creative ideas are a great way to get your creative juices flowing and come up with new solutions to problems. There are many different creative ideas out there, so you need to find the ones that fit your needs and interests. Here are some ideas to get started: 
-Create a petition: This is a great way to get people’s attention and show them how you feel about something. You can start by creating a simple Petition on change.org or any other website. Once you have made your case, offer anyone who will listen an argument for why they should change the policy. 

-Dare yourself: If you don’t know what you want or aren’t sure how to get started, take some risks and try something new. Take on an assignment or complete a project that isn’t immediately related to your current lifestyle.

The evaluation of ideas
Evaluating ideas is important in order to determine which are worth pursuing and which are not. There are a few key factors to consider when evaluating an idea:
- How original is the idea? If it's been done before, is it being done in a new or different way?
- Is the idea feasible? Can it be realistically implemented?
- What is the potential impact of the idea? Will it make a difference?
- How much support does the idea have? Are there people who believe in it and will help to make it happen?

Definition of invention:
Inventions are creative ideas that come about as a result of a person's efforts. They can be things like a new product or service, or just some new technology. Inventions can have a lot of different meanings, depending on the person who created it. For example, a clothing company might create a new style that is different from all the others out there. Or, someone might come up with a new way to make something work. There are so many different definitions for inventions, it's hard to say which one is the most accurate. But, whatever the definition may be, an invention is always something good that somebody came up with to improve the world.

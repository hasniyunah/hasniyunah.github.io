Section 1 The power of creative thinking
Creative thinking is a process that involves generating new ideas or solutions to problems. It is a skill that can be developed and improved with practice. There are many benefits to creative thinking, including the ability to solve problems more effectively, think outside the box, and come up with new ideas.

There are a few key things to keep in mind when trying to be more creative. First, it’s important to relax and not worry about being perfect. Second, try to look at things from different perspectives and ask “what if” questions. third, don’t be afraid to brainstorm with others.

The five types of creativity: Intuitive, Analytical, Pluralistic, Formal, and Ultra-formal.
Intuitive, Analytical, Pluralistic, Formal, and Ultra-formal creativity are all important types of creativity. Intuitive creativity is based on the spontaneity of the creative process. Analyses provide a plan or blueprint for creative endeavors. Pluralistic creativity involves using many different ideas to come up with a new solution or project. Formal creativity entails using specific steps and techniques to complete a task or create an outcome. Ultra-formal creativity is based on the limits of what can be done or created. It means taking ideas to their extreme and seeing if there is still something that can be accomplished by pushing boundaries.

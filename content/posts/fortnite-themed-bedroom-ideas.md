What makes a good idea?
Ideas are important, but it's not just about ideas. It's about how you develop and pursue them that makes them truly good. Here are three tips to help you make great big ideas:
1. Do your research 
Before any big idea has a chance to grow, it's important to do your research. By understanding the industry, the competition, and what people are using or thinking of, you can create a better idea that is Tacoma-specific and relevant to your area. 
2. Be persistent 
With a good idea in mind, don't be discouraged if it doesn't quite hit home at first. Keep pushing yourself and see where things take you. Once you have a solid concept and market segmentation, you can start working on developing those details (marketing strategy, product design, etc).

The power of creativity:
Creativity is a essential part of any person’s life. It can be used to come up with new ideas, to create beautiful things, or to solve complex problems. It can be a source of comfort and satisfaction, or a source of frustration and disappointment. But at what cost? creativity can lead to arrogance and delusion, can distract from reality, and can lead to stagnation in the creative process.

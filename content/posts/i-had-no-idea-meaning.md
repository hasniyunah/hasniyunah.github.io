What is invention?
Invention is the creation of a new product or idea. It can be anything from an improvement on an existing product to a completely new design. Inventions can have a huge impact on society, and sometimes they are the stuff of legends.
Many inventions are based on ideas that were first floated around in Hungary during the 18th century. These include the Hungarian alphabet, which was created by Nicholas-Jacques Conte in 1795, and the gypsy ballpoint pen, which was developed by Ferenc Puskás in 1912. Other famous inventions include the Segway vehicle and the Heath Robinson helicopters.

Creative ideas: What are they?
Creative ideas can be anything from new ways of looking at old things to taking your regular routine and turning it into something new. Whether you’re coming up with new ideas for a product or just coming up with unique ways to do something you already do, creativity is key. Here are some of our favorite creative ideas: 
1. Use recycled materials to make a unique lampshade. This may seem like a common occurrence, but sometimes finding materials that are both eco-friendly and unique is difficult. rattan, bamboo, cloth, metal all have different textures and patterns that can be used to create a beautiful shade with minimal effort. 

2. Create an outdoor seating area using recycled materials. Sometimes the simplest solution is the best! When thinking about how to organize or improve an outdoor space, consider using recycled materials instead of buying something brand new.

The Best Ideas: What are the best ideas?
Creative ideas are always a great way to get things started and can help you solve problems. Here are some of the best ideas on how to start working on your projects: 
1. Start with a blank slate: This is definitely one of the most popular ideas and can be used for both creative and everyday tasks. Create a list of ideas and then use them as a starting point for your next project. 
2. Take risks: When it comes to creativity, there’s no guarantee that everything will work out, but doing something new and risky can be a great way to get started. If something doesn’t work out, don’t be afraid to give up–you can always try again later. 
3. Collaborate: Collaborating with other people is another great way to get started on your projects.

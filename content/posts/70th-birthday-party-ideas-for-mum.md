The list goes on and on, but it is important to think about what made some of these inventions successful – from the innovative design to the marketing that helped them sell out. Here are six examples of successful inventions that you may have never heard of:
1. The television set: George Martin invented Television in 1928 and introduced it into homes across Great Britain in 1930. The TV set has become one of the most popular devices in history, with over 150 million units sold worldwide.

Outcomes of Creative Ideas: What happens when you use creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be really helpful in terms of solving problems or improving the quality of a product or service. However, they can also have negative outcomes if not used correctly. Here are five tips to get the most out of creative ideas:
1. Make sure your ideas are sound. It’s impossible to come up with great ideas without some form of understanding what you’re trying to achieve. Make sure your concepts are clear, executable, and likely to work in practice.

2. Take a step back first. While it may be tempting to take things one step further and come up with something truly unique, doing so could actually backfire if it doesn’t have a real bearing on the problem at hand.

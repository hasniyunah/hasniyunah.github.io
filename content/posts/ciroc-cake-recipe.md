Definition of innovation:
Innovation is the process of creating new and better ways to do things. It can be found in everything from designing a product to marketing a company. In today's economy, innovation is key to keeping businesses afloat and ensuring their success.
There are many definitions of innovation, but one that has been shown to be most effective is the "eight-legged stool" definition created by Michael Porter. This definition states that innovation consists of creating new products or services that are different from those currently on the market, as well as making them more affordable and user-friendly.

The term "innovation" can be used in a number of ways for businesses, including marketing, product development, and even company culture. It's important for businesses to understand what type of innovation they need in order to grow and succeed over the long term.

Creative writing:
Creative writing is a process of coming up with new and unique ideas for stories and novels. It can be quite fun to come up with new plots, characters, and settings, and to see what different people think of your work. However, it can also be difficult to make your ideas come alive in a way that makes them interesting and engaging reading experience. Here are some tips on how to get started in creative writing: 
1. Make sure you have a clear vision for your story. Once you have an idea for what you want your story to be, it’s important to make sure that the story fits within that vision. If you don’t have a solid plan for how your story will play out, it may end up becoming something that’s far from interesting or engaging reading experience. 

2. Be patient.

The history of creative art: How does it start?
Creative art has a long and complex history, with different people and cultures contributing to its creation. One of the earliest examples of creative art was considered to be cave art, which was discovered in France in the late 1800s. This type of art involved artists creating pieces out of natural materials such as flint and obsidian. It is thought that these artists used their creativity to escape from reality and explore their inner world. From there, other forms of creative art began to emerge, including sculpture and painting. While both types of art have their own unique strengths, they are united by the fact that they are created using inspiration and ideas from outside of the artist’s own experience.

The history of invention: from the ancient Egyptians to the Wright brothers
Invention ideas have been around for centuries, and it is no wonder that they continue to be a part of our daily lives today. From ancient Egyptians to the Wright brothers, some inventions have had a lasting impact on society and the world. Here are five examples:
1) The wheel was invented by the ancient Egyptians, who used it to move goods around their cities.

2) The telescope was invented by Johannes Kepler in 1611, which allowed him to see things that were previously impossible to see.

3) The telephone was invented by Samuel Morse in 1876, which allowed people to communicate with one another without having to speak directly.

4) The computer was invented by Charles Babbage in 1871, which allowed people to create new ways of doing calculations.

Conclusion: What are the benefits of creativity in art?
Creativity has been shown to be a valuable trait in art, with many benefits for both the artist and the audience. Some of these benefits include:
1. Increased creativity and productivity – When artists are able to use their creativity to come up with new ideas, they are usually more productive overall. This can free up time for them to work on other projects, which can then lead to increased sales and better profits.

2. More interesting and engaging artwork – One of the biggest benefits of creativity is that it can help break down barriers between different disciplines and make art more engaging for both audiences. This can lead to more people becoming interested in watching or reading art, which can have a positive impact on financial success.

How does creativity impact our lives: What impacts creativity in our day-to-day lives?
Creativity is an important part of our day-to-day lives. Whether it’s coming up with new ideas for a project or simply enjoying new perspectives, creativity impacts how we see the world and how we interact with others. Creative people are often seen as more innovative and resourceful than their less creative counterparts. In fact, according to a study by The Economist, the average creative person in the United Kingdom earns over £50,000 more than the average non-creative person. This implies that creativity does have a significant impact on our lives in ways that are beyond just creating new things.

Conclusion: What to do if You Start a Blog but Do Not Have Any Ideas
A lot of people start blogs, but they don't know what to do next. Here are some tips to help you get started: 
1) Choose a topic you're interested in. Once you've chosen a topic, research how to write about it effectively. You can find helpful articles and tutorials online or in books.

Patent and Patenting in Invention
Patenting is a process of making a claim to an invention. A patent gives the inventor the exclusive right to use the invention for the lifetime of the patent, or until someone else patents it. Patents can be granted for any sort of invention, from simple ideas to complex technology. While it can be expensive and time-consuming to get a patent, being able to use a patented invention can give you an edge in competition.

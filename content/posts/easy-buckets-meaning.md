When it comes to innovation, there are a few things that always seem to set a company apart from the rest. Perhaps the most well-known example is Silicon Valley’s “technology shock,” where innovative new technologies emerged suddenly and explosively in the early 1960s. At other times, companies can be credited for developing innovative products or services over time, such as Levi Strauss and Co.'s jeans becoming popular after they were first developed in the 1800s.
